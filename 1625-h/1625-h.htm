    <h2>
      Chapter 1.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The date is between twenty and thirty years ago. The place is an English
      sea-port. The time is night. And the business of the moment is&mdash;dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayor and Corporation of the town are giving a grand ball, in
      celebration of the departure of an Arctic expedition from their port. The
      ships of the expedition are two in number&mdash;the <i>Wanderer</i> and
      the <i>Sea-mew</i>. They are to sail (in search of the Northwest Passage)
      on the next day, with the morning tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor to the Mayor and Corporation! It is a brilliant ball. The band is
      complete. The room is spacious. The large conservatory opening out of it
      is pleasantly lighted with Chinese lanterns, and beautifully decorated
      with shrubs and flowers. All officers of the army and navy who are present
      wear their uniforms in honor of the occasion. Among the ladies, the
      display of dresses (a subject which the men don't understand) is
      bewildering&mdash;and the average of beauty (a subject which the men do
      understand) is the highest average attainable, in all parts of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, the dance which is in progress is a quadrille. General
      admiration selects two of the ladies who are dancing as its favorite
      objects. One is a dark beauty in the prime of womanhood&mdash;the wife of
      First Lieutenant Crayford, of the <i>Wanderer</i>. The other is a young
      girl, pale and delicate; dressed simply in white; with no ornament on her
      head but her own lovely brown hair. This is Miss Clara Burnham&mdash;an
      orphan. She is Mrs. Crayford's dearest friend, and she is to stay with
      Mrs. Crayford during the lieutenant's absence in the Arctic regions. She
      is now dancing, with the lieutenant himself for partner, and with Mrs.
      Crayford and Captain Helding (commanding officer of the <i>Wanderer</i>)
      for vis-a-vis&mdash;in plain English, for opposite couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation between Captain Helding and Mrs. Crayford, in one of the
      intervals of the dance, turns on Miss Burnham. The captain is greatly
      interested in Clara. He admires her beauty; but he thinks her manner&mdash;for
      a young girl&mdash;strangely serious and subdued. Is she in delicate
      health?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford shakes her head; sighs mysteriously; and answers,
    </p>
    <p>
      "In <i>very</i> delicate health, Captain Helding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consumptive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear that. She is a charming creature, Mrs. Crayford. She
      interests me indescribably. If I was only twenty years younger&mdash;perhaps
      (as I am not twenty years younger) I had better not finish the sentence?
      Is it indiscreet, my dear lady, to inquire what <i>is</i> the matter with
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be indiscreet, on the part of a stranger," said Mrs. Crayford.
      "An old friend like you may make any inquiries. I wish I could tell you
      what is the matter with Clara. It is a mystery to the doctors themselves.
      Some of the mischief is due, in my humble opinion, to the manner in which
      she has been brought up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! ay! A bad school, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very bad, Captain Helding. But not the sort of school which you have in
      your mind at this moment. Clara's early years were spent in a lonely old
      house in the Highlands of Scotland. The ignorant people about her were the
      people who did the mischief which I have just been speaking of. They
      filled her mind with the superstitions which are still respected as truths
      in the wild North&mdash;especially the superstition called the Second
      Sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me!" cried the captain, "you don't mean to say she believes in
      such stuff as that? In these enlightened times too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford looked at her partner with a satirical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In these enlightened times, Captain Helding, we only believe in dancing
      tables, and in messages sent from the other world by spirits who can't
      spell! By comparison with such superstitions as these, even the Second
      Sight has something&mdash;in the shape of poetry&mdash;to recommend it,
      surely? Estimate for yourself," she continued seriously, "the effect of
      such surroundings as I have described on a delicate, sensitive young
      creature&mdash;a girl with a naturally imaginative temperament leading a
      lonely, neglected life. Is it so very surprising that she should catch the
      infection of the superstition about her? And is it quite incomprehensible
      that her nervous system should suffer accordingly, at a very critical
      period of her life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, Mrs. Crayford&mdash;not at all, ma'am, as you put it. Still
      it is a little startling, to a commonplace man like me, to meet a young
      lady at a ball who believes in the Second Sight. Does she really profess
      to see into the future? Am I to understand that she positively falls into
      a trance, and sees people in distant countries, and foretells events to
      come? That is the Second Sight, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the Second Sight, captain. And that is, really and positively,
      what she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young lady who is dancing opposite to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young lady who is dancing opposite to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain waited a little&mdash;letting the new flood of information
      which had poured in on him settle itself steadily in his mind. This
      process accomplished, the Arctic explorer proceeded resolutely on his way
      to further discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask, ma'am, if you have ever seen her in a state of trance with
      your own eyes?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister and I both saw her in the trance, little more than a month
      since," Mrs. Crayford replied. "She had been nervous and irritable all the
      morning; and we took her out into the garden to breathe the fresh air.
      Suddenly, without any reason for it, the color left her face. She stood
      between us, insensible to touch, insensible to sound; motionless as stone,
      and cold as death in a moment. The first change we noticed came after a
      lapse of some minutes. Her hands began to move slowly, as if she was
      groping in the dark. Words dropped one by one from her lips, in a lost,
      vacant tone, as if she was talking in her sleep. Whether what she said
      referred to past or future I cannot tell you. She spoke of persons in a
      foreign country&mdash;perfect strangers to my sister and to me. After a
      little interval, she suddenly became silent. A momentary color appeared in
      her face, and left it again. Her eyes closed&mdash;her feet failed her&mdash;and
      she sank insensible into our arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sank insensible into your arms," repeated the captain, absorbing his new
      information. "Most extraordinary! And&mdash;in this state of health&mdash;she
      goes out to parties, and dances. More extraordinary still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are entirely mistaken," said Mrs. Crayford. "She is only here
      to-night to please me; and she is only dancing to please my husband. As a
      rule, she shuns all society. The doctor recommends change and amusement
      for her. She won't listen to him. Except on rare occasions like this, she
      persists in remaining at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding brightened at the allusion to the doctor. Something
      practical might be got out of the doctor. Scientific man. Sure to see this
      very obscure subject under a new light. "How does it strike the doctor
      now?" said the captain. "Viewed simply as a Case, ma'am, how does it
      strike the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will give no positive opinion," Mrs. Crayford answered. "He told me
      that such cases as Clara's were by no means unfamiliar to medical
      practice. 'We know,' he told me, 'that certain disordered conditions of
      the brain and the nervous system produce results quite as extraordinary as
      any that you have described&mdash;and there our knowledge ends. Neither my
      science nor any man's science can clear up the mystery in this case. It is
      an especially difficult case to deal with, because Miss Burnham's early
      associations dispose her to attach a superstitious importance to the
      malady&mdash;the hysterical malady as some doctors would call it&mdash;from
      which she suffers. I can give you instructions for preserving her general
      health; and I can recommend you to try some change in her life&mdash;provided
      you first relieve her mind of any secret anxieties that may possibly be
      preying on it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain smiled self-approvingly. The doctor had justified his
      anticipations. The doctor had suggested a practical solution of the
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! ay! At last we have hit the nail on the head! Secret anxieties. Yes!
      yes! Plain enough now. A disappointment in love&mdash;eh, Mrs. Crayford?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, Captain Helding; I am quite in the dark. Clara's confidence
      in me&mdash;in other matters unbounded&mdash;is, in this matter of her
      (supposed) anxieties, a confidence still withheld. In all else we are like
      sisters. I sometimes fear there may indeed be some trouble preying
      secretly on her mind. I sometimes feel a little hurt at her
      incomprehensible silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding was ready with his own practical remedy for this
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Encouragement is all she wants, ma'am. Take my word for it, this matter
      rests entirely with you. It's all in a nutshell. Encourage her to confide
      in you&mdash;and she <i>will</i> confide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am waiting to encourage her, captain, until she is left alone with me&mdash;after
      you have all sailed for the Arctic seas. In the meantime, will you
      consider what I have said to you as intended for your ear only? And will
      you forgive me, if I own that the turn the subject has taken does not
      tempt me to pursue it any further?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain took the hint. He instantly changed the subject; choosing, on
      this occasion, safe professional topics. He spoke of ships that were
      ordered on foreign service; and, finding that these as subjects failed to
      interest Mrs. Crayford, he spoke next of ships that were ordered home
      again. This last experiment produced its effect&mdash;an effect which the
      captain had not bargained for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," he began, "that the <i>Atalanta</i> is expected back from
      the West Coast of Africa every day? Have you any acquaintances among the
      officers of that ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As it so happened, he put those questions to Mrs. Crayford while they were
      engaged in one of the figures of the dance which brought them within
      hearing of the opposite couple. At the same moment&mdash;to the
      astonishment of her friends and admirers&mdash;Miss Clara Burnham threw
      the quadrille into confusion by making a mistake! Everybody waited to see
      her set the mistake right. She made no attempt to set it right&mdash;she
      turned deadly pale and caught her partner by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heat!" she said, faintly. "Take me away&mdash;take me into the air!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Crayford instantly led her out of the dance, and took her into
      the cool and empty conservatory, at the end of the room. As a matter of
      course, Captain Helding and Mrs. Crayford left the quadrille at the same
      time. The captain saw his way to a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the trance coming on?" he whispered. "If it is, as commander of
      the Arctic expedition, I have a particular request to make. Will the
      Second Sight oblige me by seeing the shortest way to the Northwest
      Passage, before we leave England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford declined to humor the joke. "If you will excuse my leaving
      you," she said quietly, "I will try and find out what is the matter with
      Miss Burnham."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the conservatory, Mrs. Crayford encountered her
      husband. The lieutenant was of middle age, tall and comely. A man with a
      winning simplicity and gentleness in his manner, and an irresistible
      kindness in his brave blue eyes. In one word, a man whom everybody loved&mdash;including
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed," said the lieutenant. "The heat has overcome her&mdash;that's
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford shook her head, and looked at her husband, half satirically,
      half fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear old innocent!" she exclaimed, "that excuse may do for <i>you</i>.
      For my part, I don't believe a word of it. Go and get another partner, and
      leave Clara to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the conservatory and seated herself by Clara's side.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear!" Mrs. Crayford began, "what does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't do, Clara. Try again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heat of the room&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't do, either. Say that you choose to keep your own secrets, and
      I shall understand what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara's sad, clear gray eyes looked up for the first time in Mrs.
      Crayford's face, and suddenly became dimmed with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I only dared tell you!" she murmured. "I hold so to your good opinion
      of me, Lucy&mdash;and I am so afraid of losing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford's manner changed. Her eyes rested gravely and anxiously on
      Clara's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know as well as I do that nothing can shake my affection for you,"
      she said. "Do justice, my child, to your old friend. There is nobody here
      to listen to what we say. Open your heart, Clara. I see you are in
      trouble, and I want to comfort you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara began to yield. In other words, she began to make conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you promise to keep what I tell you a secret from every living
      creature?" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford met that question, by putting a question on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does 'every living creature' include my husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband more than anybody! I love him, I revere him. He is so noble;
      he is so good! If I told him what I am going to tell you, he would despise
      me. Own it plainly, Lucy, if I am asking too much in asking you to keep a
      secret from your husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, child! When you are married, you will know that the easiest of
      all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband. I give you my promise.
      Now begin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara hesitated painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how to begin!" she exclaimed, with a burst of despair. "The
      words won't come to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must help you. Do you feel ill tonight? Do you feel as you felt
      that day when you were with my sister and me in the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not ill, you are not really affected by the heat&mdash;and yet
      you turn as pale as ashes, and you are obliged to leave the quadrille!
      There must be some reason for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a reason. Captain Helding&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Helding! What in the name of wonder has the captain to do with
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told you something about the <i>Atalanta</i>. He said the <i>Atalanta</i>
      was expected back from Africa immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and what of that? Is there anybody in whom you are interested
      coming home in the ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody whom I am afraid of is coming home in the ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford's magnificent black eyes opened wide in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Clara! do you really mean what you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little, Lucy, and you shall judge for yourself. We must go back&mdash;if
      I am to make you understand me&mdash;to the year before we knew each other&mdash;to
      the last year of my father's life. Did I ever tell you that my father
      moved southward, for the sake of his health, to a house in Kent that was
      lent to him by a friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear; I don't remember ever hearing of the house in Kent. Tell me
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to tell, except this: the new house was near a fine
      country-seat standing in its own park. The owner of the place was a
      gentleman named Wardour. He, too, was one of my father's Kentish friends.
      He had an only son."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and played nervously with her fan. Mrs. Crayford looked at her
      attentively. Clara's eyes remained fixed on her fan&mdash;Clara said no
      more. "What was the son's name?" asked Mrs. Crayford, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I right, Clara, in suspecting that Mr. Richard Wardour admired you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question produced its intended effect. The question helped Clara to go
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly knew at first," she said, "whether he admired me or not. He was
      very strange in his ways&mdash;headstrong, terribly headstrong and
      passionate; but generous and affectionate in spite of his faults of
      temper. Can you understand such a character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such characters exist by thousands. I have my faults of temper. I begin
      to like Richard already. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The days went by, Lucy, and the weeks went by. We were thrown very much
      together. I began, little by little, to have some suspicion of the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Richard helped to confirm your suspicions, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. He was not&mdash;unhappily for me&mdash;he was not that sort of man.
      He never spoke of the feeling with which he regarded me. It was I who saw
      it. I couldn't help seeing it. I did all I could to show that I was
      willing to be a sister to him, and that I could never be anything else. He
      did not understand me, or he would not, I can't say which."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Would not,' is the most likely, my dear. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been as you say. There was a strange, rough bashfulness
      about him. He confused and puzzled me. He never spoke out. He seemed to
      treat me as if our future lives had been provided for while we were
      children. What could I do, Lucy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do? You could have asked your father to end the difficulty for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! You forget what I have just told you. My father was suffering
      at that time under the illness which afterward caused his death. He was
      quite unfit to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there no one else who could help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No lady in whom you could confide?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had acquaintances among the ladies in the neighborhood. I had no
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. I hesitated; I put off coming to an explanation with him,
      unfortunately, until it was too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by too late?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear. I ought to have told you that Richard Wardour is in the
      navy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I am more interested in him than ever. Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One spring day Richard came to our house to take leave of us before he
      joined his ship. I thought he was gone, and I went into the next room. It
      was my own sitting-room, and it opened on to the garden."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard must have been watching me. He suddenly appeared in the garden.
      Without waiting for me to invite him, he walked into the room. I was a
      little startled as well as surprised, but I managed to hide it. I said,
      'What is it, Mr. Wardour?' He stepped close up to me; he said, in his
      quick, rough way: 'Clara! I am going to the African coast. If I live, I
      shall come back promoted; and we both know what will happen then.' He
      kissed me. I was half frightened, half angry. Before I could compose
      myself to say a word, he was out in the garden again&mdash;he was gone! I
      ought to have spoken, I know. It was not honorable, not kind toward him.
      You can't reproach me for my want of courage and frankness more bitterly
      than I reproach myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child, I don't reproach you. I only think you might have written
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did write."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plainly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I told him in so many words that he was deceiving himself, and that
      I could never marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plain enough, in all conscience! Having said that, surely you are not to
      blame. What are you fretting about now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose my letter has never reached him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you suppose anything of the sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I wrote required an answer, Lucy&mdash;<i>asked</i> for an answer.
      The answer has never come. What is the plain conclusion? My letter has
      never reached him. And the <i>Atalanta</i> is expected back! Richard
      Wardour is returning to England&mdash;Richard Wardour will claim me as his
      wife! You wondered just now if I really meant what I said. Do you doubt it
      still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford leaned back absently in her chair. For the first time since
      the conversation had begun, she let a question pass without making a
      reply. The truth is, Mrs. Crayford was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Clara's position plainly; she understood the disturbing effect of
      it on the mind of a young girl. Still, making all allowances, she felt
      quite at a loss, so far, to account for Clara's excessive agitation. Her
      quick observing faculty had just detected that Clara's face showed no
      signs of relief, now that she had unburdened herself of her secret. There
      was something clearly under the surface here&mdash;something of importance
      that still remained to be discovered. A shrewd doubt crossed Mrs.
      Crayford's mind, and inspired the next words which she addressed to her
      young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she said abruptly, "have you told me all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara started as if the question terrified her. Feeling sure that she now
      had the clew in her hand, Mrs. Crayford deliberately repeated her
      question, in another form of words. Instead of answering, Clara suddenly
      looked up. At the same moment a faint flush of color appeared in her face
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up instinctively on her side, Mrs. Crayford became aware of the
      presence, in the conservatory, of a young gentleman who was claiming Clara
      as his partner in the coming waltz. Mrs. Crayford fell into thinking once
      more. Had this young gentleman (she asked herself) anything to do with the
      untold end of the story? Was this the true secret of Clara Burnham's
      terror at the impending return of Richard Wardour? Mrs. Crayford decided
      on putting her doubts to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend of yours, my dear?" she asked, innocently. "Suppose you
      introduce us to each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara confusedly introduced the young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Francis Aldersley, Lucy. Mr. Aldersley belongs to the Arctic
      expedition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Attached to the expedition?" Mrs. Crayford repeated. "I am attached to
      the expedition too&mdash;in my way. I had better introduce myself, Mr.
      Aldersley, as Clara seems to have forgotten to do it for me. I am Mrs.
      Crayford. My husband is Lieutenant Crayford, of the <i>Wanderer</i>. Do
      you belong to that ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the honor, Mrs. Crayford. I belong to the <i>Sea-mew</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford's superb eyes looked shrewdly backward and forward between
      Clara and Francis Aldersley, and saw the untold sequel to Clara's story.
      The young officer was a bright, handsome, gentleman-like lad. Just the
      person to seriously complicate the difficulty with Richard Wardour! There
      was no time for making any further inquiries. The band had begun the
      prelude to the waltz, and Francis Aldersley was waiting for his partner.
      With a word of apology to the young man, Mrs. Crayford drew Clara aside
      for a moment, and spoke to her in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word, my dear, before you return to the ball-room. It may sound
      conceited, after the little you have told me; but I think I understand
      your position <i>now</i>, better than you do yourself. Do you want to hear
      my opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am longing to hear it, Lucy! I want your opinion; I want your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have both in the plainest and fewest words. First, my opinion:
      You have no choice but to come to an explanation with Mr. Wardour as soon
      as he returns. Second, my advice: If you wish to make the explanation easy
      to both sides, take care that you make it in the character of a free
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid a strong emphasis on the last three words, and looked pointedly
      at Francis Aldersley as she pronounced them. "I won't keep you from your
      partner any longer, Clara," she resumed, and led the way back to the
      ball-room.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The burden on Clara's mind weighs on it more heavily than ever, after what
      Mrs. Crayford has said to her. She is too unhappy to feel the inspiriting
      influence of the dance. After a turn round the room, she complains of
      fatigue. Mr. Francis Aldersley looks at the conservatory (still as
      invitingly cool and empty as ever); leads her back to it; and places her
      on a seat among the shrubs. She tries&mdash;very feebly&mdash;to dismiss
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let me keep you from dancing, Mr. Aldersley."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seats himself by her side, and feasts his eyes on the lovely downcast
      face that dares not turn toward him. He whispers to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call me Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      She longs to call him Frank&mdash;she loves him with all her heart. But
      Mrs. Crayford's warning words are still in her mind. She never opens her
      lips. Her lover moves a little closer, and asks another favor. Men are all
      alike on these occasions. Silence invariably encourages them to try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara! have you forgotten what I said at the concert yesterday? May I say
      it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We sail to-morrow for the Arctic seas. I may not return for years. Don't
      send me away without hope! Think of the long, lonely time in the dark
      North! Make it a happy time for <i>me</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he speaks with the fervor of a man, he is little more than a lad:
      he is only twenty years old, and he is going to risk his young life on the
      frozen deep! Clara pities him as she never pitied any human creature
      before. He gently takes her hand. She tries to release it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! not even that little favor on the last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her faithful heart takes his part, in spite of her. Her hand remains in
      his, and feels its soft persuasive pressure. She is a lost woman. It is
      only a question of time now!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara! do you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pause. She shrinks from looking at him&mdash;she trembles with
      strange contradictory sensations of pleasure and pain. His arm steals
      round her; he repeats his question in a whisper; his lips almost touch her
      little rosy ear as he says it again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closes her eyes faintly&mdash;she hears nothing but those words&mdash;feels
      nothing but his arm round her&mdash;forgets Mrs. Crayford's warning&mdash;forgets
      Richard Wardour himself&mdash;turns suddenly, with a loving woman's
      desperate disregard of everything but her love&mdash;nestles her head on
      his bosom, and answers him in that way, at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifts the beautiful drooping head&mdash;their lips meet in their first
      kiss&mdash;they are both in heaven: it is Clara who brings them back to
      earth again with a start&mdash;it is Clara who says, "Oh! what have I
      done?"&mdash;as usual, when it is too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank answers the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made me happy, my angel. Now, when I come back, I come back to
      make you my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shudders. She remembers Richard Wardour again at those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind!" she says, "nobody is to know we are engaged till I permit you to
      mention it. Remember that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He promises to remember it. His arm tries to wind round her once more. No!
      She is mistress of herself; she can positively dismiss him now&mdash;after
      she has let him kiss her!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!" she says. "I want to see Mrs. Crayford. Find her! Say I am here,
      waiting to speak to her. Go at once, Frank&mdash;for my sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no alternative but to obey her. His eyes drink a last draught of
      her beauty. He hurries away on his errand&mdash;the happiest man in the
      room. Five minutes since she was only his partner in the dance. He has
      spoken&mdash;and she has pledged herself to be his partner for life!

    <h2>
      Chapter 4.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not easy to find Mrs. Crayford in the crowd. Searching here, and
      searching there, Frank became conscious of a stranger, who appeared to be
      looking for somebody, on his side. He was a dark, heavy-browed,
      strongly-built man, dressed in a shabby old naval officer's uniform. His
      manner&mdash;strikingly resolute and self-contained&mdash;was unmistakably
      the manner of a gentleman. He wound his way slowly through the crowd;
      stopping to look at every lady whom he passed, and then looking away again
      with a frown. Little by little he approached the conservatory&mdash;entered
      it, after a moment's reflection&mdash;detected the glimmer of a white
      dress in the distance, through the shrubs and flowers&mdash;advanced to
      get a nearer view of the lady&mdash;and burst into Clara's presence with a
      cry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet. She stood before him speechless, motionless,
      struck to stone. All her life was in her eyes&mdash;the eyes which told
      her she was looking at Richard Wardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I startled you, my darling. I forgot everything but the
      happiness of seeing you again. We only reached our moorings two hours
      since. I was some time inquiring after you, and some time getting my
      ticket when they told me you were at the ball. Wish me joy, Clara! I am
      promoted. I have come back to make you my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary change passed over the blank terror of her face. Her color
      rose faintly, her lips moved. She abruptly put a question to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you get my letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. "A letter from you? I never received it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentary animation died out of her face again. She drew back from him
      and dropped into a chair. He advanced toward her, astonished and alarmed.
      She shrank in the chair&mdash;shrank, as if she was frightened of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara, you have not even shaken hands with me! What does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; waiting and watching her. She made no reply. A flash of the
      quick temper in him leaped up in his eyes. He repeated his last words in
      louder and sterner tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied this time. His tone had hurt her&mdash;his tone had roused her
      sinking courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means, Mr. Wardour, that you have been mistaken from the first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have I been mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been under a wrong impression, and you have given me no
      opportunity of setting you right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way have I been wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been too hasty and too confident about yourself and about me.
      You have entirely misunderstood me. I am grieved to distress you, but for
      your sake I must speak plainly. I am your friend always, Mr. Wardour. I
      can never be your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He mechanically repeated the last words. He seemed to doubt whether he had
      heard her aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can never be my wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. She was incapable of telling him a falsehood. She was
      ashamed to tell him the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over her, and suddenly possessed himself of her hand. Holding
      her hand firmly, he stooped a little lower; searching for the signs which
      might answer him in her face. His own face darkened slowly while he
      looked. He was beginning to suspect her; and he acknowledged it in his
      next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has changed you toward me, Clara. Somebody has influenced you
      against me. Is it&mdash;you force me to ask the question&mdash;is it some
      other man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no right to ask me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on without noticing what she had said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has that other man come between you and me? I speak plainly on my side.
      Speak plainly on yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>have</i> spoken. I have nothing more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. She saw the warning light which told of the fire within
      him, growing brighter and brighter in his eyes. She felt his grasp
      strengthening on her hand. He appealed to her for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reflect," he said, "reflect before it is too late. Your silence will not
      serve you. If you persist in not answering me, I shall take your silence
      as a confession. Do you hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara Burnham! I am not to be trifled with. Clara Burnham! I insist on
      the truth. Are you false to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She resented that searching question with a woman's keen sense of the
      insult that is implied in doubting her to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Wardour! you forget yourself when you call me to account in that way.
      I never encouraged you. I never gave you promise or pledge&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He passionately interrupted her before she could say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have engaged yourself in my absence. Your words own it; your looks
      own it! You have engaged yourself to another man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I <i>have</i> engaged myself, what right have you to complain of it?"
      she answered firmly. "What right have you to control my actions&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next words died away on her lips. He suddenly dropped her hand. A
      marked change appeared in the expression of his eyes&mdash;a change which
      told her of the terrible passions that she had let loose in him. She read,
      dimly read, something in his face which made her tremble&mdash;not for
      herself, but for Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the dark color faded out of his face. His deep voice
      dropped suddenly to a low and quiet tone as he spoke the parting words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say no more, Miss Burnham&mdash;you have said enough. I am answered; I am
      dismissed." He paused, and, stepping close up to her, laid his hand on her
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The time may come," he said, "when I shall forgive you. But the man who
      has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, Mrs. Crayford, entering the conservatory, was met by
      one of the attendants at the ball. The man stopped as if he wished to
      speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, ma'am. Do you happen to have a smelling-bottle about
      you? There is a young lady in the conservatory who is taken faint."

      Chapter 5.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning of the next day&mdash;the morning on which the ships were to
      sail&mdash;came bright and breezy. Mrs. Crayford, having arranged to
      follow her husband to the water-side, and see the last of him before he
      embarked, entered Clara's room on her way out of the house, anxious to
      hear how her young friend passed the night. To her astonishment she found
      Clara had risen, and was dressed, like herself, to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean, my dear? After what you suffered last night&mdash;after
      the shock of seeing that man&mdash;why don't you take my advice and rest
      in your bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't rest. I have not slept all night. Have you been out yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen or heard anything of Richard Wardour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an extraordinary question!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer my question! Don't trifle with me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compose yourself, Clara. I have neither seen nor heard anything of
      Richard Wardour. Take my word for it, he is far enough away by this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! He is here! He is near us! All night long the presentiment has
      pursued me&mdash;Frank and Richard Wardour will meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child! what are you thinking of? They are total strangers to each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something will happen to bring them together. I feel it! I know it! They
      will meet&mdash;there will be a mortal quarrel between them&mdash;and I
      shall be to blame. Oh, Lucy! why didn't I take your advice? Why was I mad
      enough to let Frank know that I loved him? Are you going to the
      landing-stage? I am all ready&mdash;I must go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not think of it, Clara. There will be crowding and confusion at
      the water-side. You are not strong enough to bear it. Wait&mdash;I won't
      be long away&mdash;wait till I come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must and will go with you! Crowd? <i>He</i> will be among the crowd!
      Confusion? In that confusion <i>he</i> will find his way to Frank! Don't
      ask me to wait. I shall go mad if I wait. I shall not know a moment's ease
      until I have seen Frank, with my own eyes, safe in the boat which takes
      him to his ship! You have got your bonnet on; what are we stopping here
      for? Come! or I shall go without you. Look at the clock; we have not a
      moment to lose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to contend with her. Mrs. Crayford yielded. The two women
      left the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landing-stage, as Mrs. Crayford had predicted, was thronged with
      spectators. Not only the relatives and friends of the Arctic voyagers, but
      strangers as well, had assembled in large numbers to see the ships sail.
      Clara's eyes wandered affrightedly hither and thither among the strange
      faces in the crowd; searching for the one face that she dreaded to see,
      and not finding it. So completely were her nerves unstrung, that she
      started with a cry of alarm on suddenly hearing Frank's voice behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>Sea-mew</i>'s boats are waiting," he said. "I must go, darling.
      How pale you are looking, Clara! Are you ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She never answered. She questioned him with wild eyes and trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has anything happened to you, Frank? anything out of the common?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank laughed at the strange question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything out of the common?" he repeated. "Nothing that I know of, except
      sailing for the Arctic seas. That's out of the common, I suppose&mdash;isn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has anybody spoken to you since last night? Has any stranger followed you
      in the street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank turned in blank amazement to Mrs. Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth does she mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford's lively invention supplied her with an answer on the spur
      of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you believe in dreams, Frank? Of course you don't! Clara has been
      dreaming about you; and Clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams.
      That's all&mdash;it's not worth talking about. Hark! they are calling you.
      Say good-by, or you will be too late for the boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank took Clara's hand. Long afterward&mdash;in the dark Arctic days, in
      the dreary Arctic nights&mdash;he remembered how coldly and how passively
      that hand lay in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Courage, Clara!" he said, gayly. "A sailor's sweetheart must accustom
      herself to partings. The time will soon pass. Good-by, my darling!
      Good-by, my wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed the cold hand; he looked his last&mdash;for many a long year,
      perhaps!&mdash;at the pale and beautiful face. "How she loves me!" he
      thought. "How the parting distresses her!" He still held her hand; he
      would have lingered longer, if Mrs. Crayford had not wisely waived all
      ceremony and pushed him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies followed him at a safe distance through the crowd, and saw
      him step into the boat. The oars struck the water; Frank waved his cap to
      Clara. In a moment more a vessel at anchor hid the boat from view. They
      had seen the last of him on his way to the Frozen Deep!
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Richard Wardour in the boat," said Mrs. Crayford. "No Richard Wardour
      on the shore. Let this be a lesson to you, my dear. Never be foolish
      enough to believe in presentiments again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara's eyes still wandered suspiciously to and fro among the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not satisfied yet?" asked Mrs. Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Clara answered, "I am not satisfied yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! still looking for him? This is really too absurd. Here is my
      husband coming. I shall tell him to call a cab, and send you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara drew back a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't be in the way, Lucy, while you are taking leave of your good
      husband," she said. "I will wait here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait here! What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For something which I may yet see; or for something which I may still
      hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard Wardour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard Wardour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford turned to her husband without another word. Clara's
      infatuation was beyond the reach of remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boats of the <i>Wanderer</i> took the place at the landing-stage
      vacated by the boats of the <i>Sea-mew</i>. A burst of cheering among the
      outer ranks of the crowd announced the arrival of the commander of the
      expedition on the scene. Captain Helding appeared, looking right and left
      for his first lieutenant. Finding Crayford with his wife, the captain made
      his apologies for interfering, with his best grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him up to his professional duties for one minute, Mrs. Crayford, and
      you shall have him back again for half an hour. The Arctic expedition is
      to blame, my dear lady&mdash;not the captain&mdash;for parting man and
      wife. In Crayford's place, I should have left it to the bachelors to find
      the Northwest Passage, and have stopped at home with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Excusing himself in those bluntly complimentary terms, Captain Helding
      drew the lieutenant aside a few steps, accidentally taking a direction
      that led the two officers close to the place at which Clara was standing.
      Both the captain and the lieutenant were too completely absorbed in their
      professional business to notice her. Neither the one nor the other had the
      faintest suspicion that she could and did hear every word of the talk that
      passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You received my note this morning?" the captain began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Captain Helding, or I should have been on board the ship
      before this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going on board myself at once," the captain proceeded, "but I must
      ask you to keep your boat waiting for half an hour more. You will be all
      the longer with your wife, you know. I thought of that, Crayford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am much obliged to you, Captain Helding. I suppose there is some other
      reason for inverting the customary order of things, and keeping the
      lieutenant on shore after the captain is on board?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true! there <i>is</i> another reason. I want you to wait for a
      volunteer who has just joined us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A volunteer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He has his outfit to get in a hurry, and he may be half an hour
      late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather a sudden appointment, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt. Very sudden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;pardon me&mdash;it's rather a long time (as we are situated) to
      keep the ships waiting for one man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, again. But a man who is worth having is worth waiting for.
      This man is worth having; this man is worth his weight in gold to such an
      expedition as ours. Seasoned to all climates and all fatigues&mdash;a
      strong fellow, a brave fellow, a clever fellow&mdash;in short, an
      excellent officer. I know him well, or I should never have taken him. The
      country gets plenty of work out of my new volunteer, Crayford. He only
      returned yesterday from foreign service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He only returned yesterday from foreign service! And he volunteers this
      morning to join the Arctic expedition? You astonish me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say I do! You can't be more astonished than I was, when he
      presented himself at my hotel and told me what he wanted. 'Why, my good
      fellow, you have just got home,' I said. 'Are you weary of your freedom,
      after only a few hours' experience of it?' His answer rather startled me.
      He said, 'I am weary of my life, sir. I have come home and found a trouble
      to welcome me, which goes near to break my heart. If I don't take refuge
      in absence and hard work, I am a lost man. Will you give me a refuge?'
      That's what he said, Crayford, word for word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ask him to explain himself further?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I! I knew his value, and I took the poor devil on the spot, without
      pestering him with any more questions. No need to ask him to explain
      himself. The facts speak for themselves in these cases. The old story, my
      good friend! There's a woman at the bottom of it, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford, waiting for the return of her husband as patiently as she
      could, was startled by feeling a hand suddenly laid on her shoulder. She
      looked round, and confronted Clara. Her first feeling of surprise changed
      instantly to alarm. Clara was trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter? What has frightened you, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy! I <i>have</i> heard of him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard Wardour again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember what I told you. I have heard every word of the conversation
      between Captain Helding and your husband. A man came to the captain this
      morning and volunteered to join the <i>Wanderer</i>. The captain has taken
      him. The man is Richard Wardour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean it! Are you sure? Did you hear Captain Helding mention his
      name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how do you know it's Richard Wardour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me! I am as certain of it, as that I am standing here! They are
      going away together, Lucy&mdash;away to the eternal ice and snow. My
      foreboding has come true! The two will meet&mdash;the man who is to marry
      me and the man whose heart I have broken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your foreboding has <i>not</i> come true, Clara! The men have not met
      here&mdash;the men are not likely to meet elsewhere. They are appointed to
      separate ships. Frank belongs to the <i>Sea-mew</i>, and Wardour to the <i>Wanderer</i>.
      See! Captain Helding has done. My husband is coming this way. Let me make
      sure. Let me speak to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Crayford returned to his wife. She spoke to him instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "William! you have got a new volunteer who joins the <i>Wanderer</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you have been listening to the captain and me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How in the world did you manage to hear what we said to each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name? has the captain given you his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't excite yourself, my dear. Look! you are positively alarming Miss
      Burnham. The new volunteer is a perfect stranger to us. There is his name&mdash;last
      on the ship's list."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford snatched the list out of her husband's hand, and read the
      name:
    </p>

    <p>
      Good-by to England! Good-by to inhabited and civilized regions of the
      earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years have passed since the voyagers sailed from their native shores.
      The enterprise has failed&mdash;the Arctic expedition is lost and
      ice-locked in the Polar wastes. The good ships <i>Wanderer</i> and <i>Sea-mew</i>,
      entombed in ice, will never ride the buoyant waters more. Stripped of
      their lighter timbers, both vessels have been used for the construction of
      huts, erected on the nearest land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest of the two buildings which now shelter the lost men is
      occupied by the surviving officers and crew of the <i>Sea-mew</i>. On one
      side of the principal room are the sleeping berths and the fire-place. The
      other side discloses a broad doorway (closed by a canvas screen), which
      serves as a means of communication with an inner apartment, devoted to the
      superior officers. A hammock is slung to the rough raftered roof of the
      main room, as an extra bed. A man, completely hidden by his bedclothes, is
      sleeping in the hammock. By the fireside there is a second man&mdash;supposed
      to be on the watch&mdash;fast asleep, poor wretch! at the present moment.
      Behind the sleeper stands an old cask, which serves for a table. The
      objects at present on the table are, a pestle and mortar, and a
      saucepanful of the dry bones of animals&mdash;in plain words, the dinner
      for the day. By way of ornament to the dull brown walls, icicles appear in
      the crevices of the timber, gleaming at intervals in the red fire-light.
      No wind whistles outside the lonely dwelling&mdash;no cry of bird or beast
      is heard. Indoors, and out-of-doors, the awful silence of the Polar desert
      reigns, for the moment, undisturbed.

    <h2>
      Chapter 7.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first sound that broke the silence came from the inner apartment. An
      officer lifted the canvas screen in the hut of the <i>Sea-mew</i> and
      entered the main room. Cold and privation had badly thinned the ranks. The
      commander of the ship&mdash;Captain Ebsworth&mdash;was dangerously ill.
      The first lieutenant was dead. An officer of the <i>Wanderer</i> filled
      their places for the time, with Captain Helding's permission. The officer
      so employed was&mdash;Lieutenant Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the man at the fireside, and awakened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jump up, Bateson! It's your turn to be relieved."
    </p>
    <p>
      The relief appeared, rising from a heap of old sails at the back of the
      hut. Bateson vanished, yawning, to his bed. Lieutenant Crayford walked
      backward and forward briskly, trying what exercise would do toward warming
      his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pestle and mortar on the cask attracted his attention. He stopped and
      looked up at the man in the hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must rouse the cook," he said to himself, with a smile. "That fellow
      little thinks how useful he is in keeping up my spirits. The most
      inveterate croaker and grumbler in the world&mdash;and yet, according to
      his own account, the only cheerful man in the whole ship's company. John
      Want! John Want! Rouse up, there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A head rose slowly out of the bedclothes, covered with a red night-cap. A
      melancholy nose rested itself on the edge of the hammock. A voice, worthy
      of the nose, expressed its opinion of the Arctic climate, in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! Lord! here's all my breath on my blanket. Icicles, if you please,
      sir, all round my mouth and all over my blanket. Every time I have snored,
      I've frozen something. When a man gets the cold into him to that extent
      that he ices his own bed, it can't last much longer. Never mind! <i>I</i>
      don't grumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford tapped the saucepan of bones impatiently. John Want lowered
      himself to the floor&mdash;grumbling all the way&mdash;by a rope attached
      to the rafters at his bed head. Instead of approaching his superior
      officer and his saucepan, he hobbled, shivering, to the fire-place, and
      held his chin as close as he possibly could over the fire. Crayford looked
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halloo! what are you doing there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thawing my beard, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here directly, and set to work on these bones."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Want remained immovably attached to the fire-place, holding something
      else over the fire. Crayford began to lose his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil are you about now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thawing my watch, sir. It's been under my pillow all night, and the cold
      has stopped it. Cheerful, wholesome, bracing sort of climate to live in;
      isn't it, sir? Never mind! <i>I</i> don't grumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we all know that. Look here! Are these bones pounded small enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Want suddenly approached the lieutenant, and looked at him with an
      appearance of the deepest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll excuse me, sir," he said; "how very hollow your voice sounds this
      morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind my voice. The bones! the bones!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;the bones. They'll take a trifle more pounding. I'll do my
      best with them, sir, for your sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Want shook his head, and looked at Crayford with a dreary smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I shall have the honor of making much more bone soup for
      you, sir. Do you think yourself you'll last long, sir? I don't, saving
      your presence. I think about another week or ten days will do for us all.
      Never mind! <i>I</i> don't grumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured the bones into the mortar, and began to pound them&mdash;under
      protest. At the same moment a sailor appeared, entering from the inner
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A message from Captain Ebsworth, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The captain is worse than ever with his freezing pains, sir. He wants to
      see you immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go at once. Rouse the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering in those terms, Crayford returned to the inner hut, followed by
      the sailor. John Want shook his head again, and smiled more drearily than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rouse the doctor?" he repeated. "Suppose the doctor should be frozen? He
      hadn't a ha'porth of warmth in him last night, and his voice sounded like
      a whisper in a speaking-trumpet. Will the bones do now? Yes, the bones
      will do now. Into the saucepan with you," cried John Want, suiting the
      action to the word, "and flavor the hot water if you can! When I remember
      that I was once an apprentice at a pastry-cook's&mdash;when I think of the
      gallons of turtle-soup that this hand has stirred up in a jolly hot
      kitchen&mdash;and when I find myself mixing bones and hot water for soup,
      and turning into ice as fast as I can; if I wasn't of a cheerful
      disposition I should feel inclined to grumble. John Want! John Want!
      whatever had you done with your natural senses when you made up your mind
      to go to sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A new voice hailed the cook, speaking from one of the bed-places in the
      side of the hut. It was the voice of Francis Aldersley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that croaking over the fire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Croaking?" repeated John Want, with the air of a man who considered
      himself the object of a gratuitous insult. "Croaking? You don't find your
      own voice at all altered for the worse&mdash;do you, Mr. Frank? I don't
      give <i>him</i>," John proceeded, speaking confidentially to himself,
      "more than six hours to last. He's one of your grumblers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing there?" asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm making bone soup, sir, and wondering why I ever went to sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and why did you go to sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not certain, Mr. Frank. Sometimes I think it was natural perversity;
      sometimes I think it was false pride at getting over sea-sickness;
      sometimes I think it was reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of
      me <i>not</i> to go to sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank laughed. "You're an odd fellow. What do you mean by false pride at
      getting over sea-sickness? Did you get over sea-sickness in some new way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Want's dismal face brightened in spite of himself. Frank had recalled
      to the cook's memory one of the noteworthy passages in the cook's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, sir!" he said. "If ever a man cured sea-sickness in a new way
      yet, I am that man&mdash;I got over it, Mr. Frank, by dint of hard eating.
      I was a passenger on board a packet-boat, sir, when first I saw blue
      water. A nasty lopp of a sea came on at dinner-time, and I began to feel
      queer the moment the soup was put on the table. 'Sick?' says the captain.
      'Rather, sir,' says I. 'Will you try my cure?' says the captain.
      'Certainly, sir,' says I. 'Is your heart in your mouth yet?' says the
      captain. 'Not quite, sir,' says I. 'Mock-turtle soup?' says the captain,
      and helps me. I swallow a couple of spoonfuls, and turn as white as a
      sheet. The captain cocks his eye at me. 'Go on deck, sir,' says he; 'get
      rid of the soup, and then come back to the cabin.' I got rid of the soup,
      and came back to the cabin. 'Cod's head-and-shoulders,' says the captain,
      and helps me. 'I can't stand it, sir,' says I. 'You must,' says the
      captain, 'because it's the cure.' I crammed down a mouthful, and turned
      paler than ever. 'Go on deck,' says the captain. 'Get rid of the cod's
      head, and come back to the cabin.' Off I go, and back I come. 'Boiled leg
      of mutton and trimmings,' says the captain, and helps me. 'No fat, sir,'
      says I. 'Fat's the cure,' says the captain, and makes me eat it. 'Lean's
      the cure,' says the captain, and makes me eat it. 'Steady?' says the
      captain. 'Sick,' says I. 'Go on deck,' says the captain; 'get rid of the
      boiled leg of mutton and trimmings and come back to the cabin.' Off I go,
      staggering&mdash;back I come, more dead than alive. 'Deviled kidneys,'
      says the captain. I shut my eyes, and got 'em down. 'Cure's beginning,'
      says the captain. 'Mutton-chop and pickles.' I shut my eyes, and got <i>them</i>
      down. 'Broiled ham and cayenne pepper,' says the captain. 'Glass of stout
      and cranberry tart. Want to go on deck again?' 'No, sir,' says I. 'Cure's
      done,' says the captain. 'Never you give in to your stomach, and your
      stomach will end in giving in to you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having stated the moral purpose of his story in those unanswerable words,
      John Want took himself and his saucepan into the kitchen. A moment later,
      Crayford returned to the hut and astonished Frank Aldersley by an
      unexpected question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything in your berth, Frank, that you set a value on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing that I set the smallest value on&mdash;when I am out of it," he
      replied. "What does your question mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are almost as short of fuel as we are of provisions," Crayford
      proceeded. "Your berth will make good firing. I have directed Bateson to
      be here in ten minutes with his ax."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very attentive and considerate on your part," said Frank. "What is to
      become of me, if you please, when Bateson has chopped my bed into
      fire-wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you guess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the cold has stupefied me. The riddle is beyond my reading.
      Suppose you give me a hint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. There will be beds to spare soon&mdash;there is to be a change
      at last in our wretched lives here. Do you see it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's eyes sparkled. He sprang out of his berth, and waved his fur cap
      in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See it?" he exclaimed; "of course I do! The exploring party is to start
      at last. Do I go with the expedition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not very long since you were in the doctor's hands, Frank," said
      Crayford, kindly. "I doubt if you are strong enough yet to make one of the
      exploring party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strong enough or not," returned Frank, "any risk is better than pining
      and perishing here. Put me down, Crayford, among those who volunteer to
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Volunteers will not be accepted, in this case," said Crayford. "Captain
      Helding and Captain Ebsworth see serious objections, as we are situated,
      to that method of proceeding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they mean to keep the appointments in their own hands?" asked Frank.
      "I for one object to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little," said Crayford. "You were playing backgammon the other day
      with one of the officers. Does the board belong to him or to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It belongs to me. I have got it in my locker here. What do you want with
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want the dice and the box for casting lots. The captains have arranged&mdash;most
      wisely, as I think&mdash;that Chance shall decide among us who goes with
      the expedition and who stays behind in the huts. The officers and crew of
      the <i>Wanderer</i> will be here in a few minutes to cast the lots.
      Neither you nor any one can object to that way of deciding among us.
      Officers and men alike take their chance together. Nobody can grumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite satisfied," said Frank. "But I know of one man among the
      officers who is sure to make objections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know him well enough, too. The 'Bear of the Expeditions' Richard
      Wardour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank! Frank! you have a bad habit of letting your tongue run away with
      you. Don't repeat that stupid nickname when you talk of my good friend,
      Richard Wardour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your good friend? Crayford! your liking for that man amazes me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford laid his hand kindly on Frank's shoulder. Of all the officers of
      the <i>Sea-mew</i>, Crayford's favorite was Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should it amaze you?" he asked. "What opportunities have you had of
      judging? You and Wardour have always belonged to different ships. I have
      never seen you in Wardour's society for five minutes together. How can <i>you</i>
      form a fair estimate of his character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take the general estimate of his character," Frank answered. "He has
      got his nickname because he is the most unpopular man in his ship. Nobody
      likes him&mdash;there must be some reason for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one reason for it," Crayford rejoined. "Nobody understands
      Richard Wardour. I am not talking at random. Remember, I sailed from
      England with him in the <i>Wanderer</i>; and I was only transferred to the
      <i>Sea-mew</i> long after we were locked up in the ice. I was Richard
      Wardour's companion on board ship for months, and I learned there to do
      him justice. Under all his outward defects, I tell you, there beats a
      great and generous heart. Suspend your opinion, my lad, until you know my
      friend as well as I do. No more of this now. Give me the dice and the
      box."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank opened his locker. At the same moment the silence of the snowy waste
      outside was broken by a shouting of voices hailing the hut&mdash;"<i>Sea-mew</i>,
      ahoy!"

    <h2>
      Chapter 8.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sailor on watch opened the outer door. There, plodding over the
      ghastly white snow, were the officers of the <i>Wanderer</i> approaching
      the hut. There, scattered under the merciless black sky, were the crew,
      with the dogs and the sledges, waiting the word which was to start them on
      their perilous and doubtful journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding of the <i>Wanderer</i>, accompanied by his officers,
      entered the hut, in high spirits at the prospect of a change. Behind them,
      lounging in slowly by himself, was a dark, sullen, heavy-browed man. He
      neither spoke, nor offered his hand to anybody: he was the one person
      present who seemed to be perfectly indifferent to the fate in store for
      him. This was the man whom his brother officers had nicknamed the Bear of
      the Expedition. In other words&mdash;Richard Wardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford advanced to welcome Captain Helding. Frank, remembering the
      friendly reproof which he had just received, passed over the other
      officers of the <i>Wanderer</i>, and made a special effort to be civil to
      Crayford's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Mr. Wardour," he said. "We may congratulate each other on
      the chance of leaving this horrible place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> may think it horrible," Wardour retorted; "I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it? Good Heavens! why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because there are no women here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank turned to his brother officers, without making any further advances
      in the direction of Richard Wardour. The Bear of the Expedition was more
      unapproachable than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the hut had become thronged by the able-bodied officers
      and men of the two ships. Captain Helding, standing in the midst of them,
      with Crayford by his side, proceeded to explain the purpose of the
      contemplated expedition to the audience which surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother officers and men of the <i>Wanderer</i> and <i>Sea-mew</i>, it is
      my duty to tell you, very briefly, the reasons which have decided Captain
      Ebsworth and myself on dispatching an exploring party in search of help.
      Without recalling all the hardships we have suffered for the last two
      years&mdash;the destruction, first of one of our ships, then of the other;
      the death of some of our bravest and best companions; the vain battles we
      have been fighting with the ice and snow, and boundless desolation of
      these inhospitable regions&mdash;without dwelling on these things, it is
      my duty to remind you that this, the last place in which we have taken
      refuge, is far beyond the track of any previous expedition, and that
      consequently our chance of being discovered by any rescuing parties that
      may be sent to look after us is, to say the least of it, a chance of the
      most uncertain kind. You all agree with me, gentlemen, so far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers (with the exception of Wardour, who stood apart in sullen
      silence) all agreed, so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is therefore urgently necessary that we should make another, and
      probably a last, effort to extricate ourselves. The winter is not far off,
      game is getting scarcer and scarcer, our stock of provisions is running
      low, and the sick&mdash;especially, I am sorry to say, the sick in the <i>Wanderer</i>'s
      hut&mdash;are increasing in number day by day. We must look to our own
      lives, and to the lives of those who are dependent on us; and we have no
      time to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers echoed the words cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right! right! No time to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The plan proposed is, that a detachment of the able-bodied officers and
      men among us should set forth this very day, and make another effort to
      reach the nearest inhabited settlements, from which help and provisions
      may be dispatched to those who remain here. The new direction to be taken,
      and the various precautions to be adopted, are all drawn out ready. The
      only question now before us is, Who is to stop here, and who is to
      undertake the journey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers answered the question with one accord&mdash;"Volunteers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The men echoed their officers. "Ay, ay, volunteers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour still preserved his sullen silence. Crayford noticed him. standing
      apart from the rest, and appealed to him personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you say nothing?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," Wardour answered. "Go or stay, it's all one to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you don't really mean that?" said Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to hear it, Wardour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding answered the general suggestion in favor of volunteering
      by a question which instantly checked the rising enthusiasm of the
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "suppose we say volunteers. Who volunteers to stop in the
      huts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence. The officers and men looked at each other
      confusedly. The captain continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see we can't settle it by volunteering. You all want to go. Every man
      among us who has the use of his limbs naturally wants to go. But what is
      to become of those who have not got the use of their limbs? Some of us
      must stay here, and take care of the sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody admitted that this was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we get back again," said the captain, "to the old question&mdash;Who
      among the able-bodied is to go? and who is to stay? Captain Ebsworth says,
      and I say, let chance decide it. Here are dice. The numbers run as high as
      twelve&mdash;double sixes. All who throw under six, stay; all who throw
      over six, go. Officers of the <i>Wanderer</i> and the <i>Sea-mew</i>, do
      you agree to that way of meeting the difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the officers agreed, with the one exception of Wardour, who still kept
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men of the <i>Wanderer</i> and <i>Sea-mew</i>, your officers agree to
      cast lots. Do you agree too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The men agreed without a dissentient voice. Crayford handed the box and
      the dice to Captain Helding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You throw first, sir. Under six, 'Stay.' Over six, 'Go.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helding cast the dice; the top of the cask serving for a table. He
      threw seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go," said Crayford. "I congratulate you, sir. Now for my own chance." He
      cast the dice in his turn. Three! "Stay! Ah, well! well! if I can do my
      duty, and be of use to others, what does it matter whether I go or stay?
      Wardour, you are next, in the absence of your first lieutenant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour prepared to cast, without shaking the dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shake the box, man!" cried Crayford. "Give yourself a chance of luck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour persisted in letting the dice fall out carelessly, just as they
      lay in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I!" he muttered to himself. "I've done with luck." Saying those
      words, he threw down the empty box, and seated himself on the nearest
      chest, without looking to see how the dice had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford examined them. "Six!" he exclaimed. "There! you have a second
      chance, in spite of yourself. You are neither under nor over&mdash;you
      throw again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" growled the Bear. "It's not worth the trouble of getting up for.
      Somebody else throw for me." He suddenly looked at Frank. "You! you have
      got what the women call a lucky face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank appealed to Crayford. "Shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if he wishes it," said Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank cast the dice. "Two! He stays! Wardour, I am sorry I have thrown
      against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go or stay," reiterated Wardour, "it's all one to me. You will be
      luckier, young one, when you cast for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank cast for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight. Hurrah! I go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I tell you?" said Wardour. "The chance was yours. You have
      thriven on my ill luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, as he spoke, to leave the hut. Crayford stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything particular to do, Richard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has anybody to do here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little, then. I want to speak to you when this business is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to give me any more good advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't look at me in that sour way, Richard. I am going to ask you a
      question about something which concerns yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour yielded without a word more. He returned to his chest, and
      cynically composed himself to slumber. The casting of the lots went on
      rapidly among the officers and men. In another half-hour chance had
      decided the question of "Go" or "Stay" for all alike. The men left the
      hut. The officers entered the inner apartment for a last conference with
      the bed-ridden captain of the <i>Sea-mew</i>. Wardour and Crayford were
      left together, alone.

    <h2>
      Chapter 9.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Crayford touched his friend on the shoulder to rouse him. Wardour looked
      up, impatiently, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just asleep," he said. "Why do you wake me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look round you, Richard. We are alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;and what of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to speak to you privately; and this is my opportunity. You have
      disappointed and surprised me to-day. Why did you say it was all one to
      you whether you went or stayed? Why are you the only man among us who
      seems to be perfectly indifferent whether we are rescued or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can a man always give a reason for what is strange in his manner or his
      words?" Wardour retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can try," said Crayford, quietly&mdash;"when his friend asks him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour's manner softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," he said. "I <i>will</i> try. Do you remember the first
      night at sea when we sailed from England in the <i>Wanderer</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As well as if it was yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A calm, still night," the other went on, thoughtfully. "No clouds, no
      stars. Nothing in the sky but the broad moon, and hardly a ripple to break
      the path of light she made in the quiet water. Mine was the middle watch
      that night. You came on deck, and found me alone&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Crayford took his hand, and finished the sentence for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone&mdash;and in tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last I shall ever shed," Wardour added, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that! There are times when a man is to be pitied indeed, if he
      can shed no tears. Go on, Richard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour proceeded&mdash;still following the old recollections, still
      preserving his gentler tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have quarreled with any other man who had surprised me at that
      moment," he said. "There was something, I suppose, in your voice when you
      asked my pardon for disturbing me, that softened my heart. I told you I
      had met with a disappointment which had broken me for life. There was no
      need to explain further. The only hopeless wretchedness in this world is
      the wretchedness that women cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the only unalloyed happiness," said Crayford, "the happiness that
      women bring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be your experience of them," Wardour answered; "mine is
      different. All the devotion, the patience, the humility, the worship that
      there is in man, I laid at the feet of a woman. She accepted the offering
      as women do&mdash;accepted it, easily, gracefully, unfeelingly&mdash;accepted
      it as a matter of course. I left England to win a high place in my
      profession, before I dared to win <i>her</i>. I braved danger, and faced
      death. I staked my life in the fever swamps of Africa, to gain the
      promotion that I only desired for her sake&mdash;and gained it. I came
      back to give her all, and to ask nothing in return, but to rest my weary
      heart in the sunshine of her smile. And her own lips&mdash;the lips I had
      kissed at parting&mdash;told me that another man had robbed me of her. I
      spoke but few words when I heard that confession, and left her forever.
      'The time may come,' I told her, 'when I shall forgive <i>you</i>. But the
      man who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met.'
      Don't ask me who he was! I have yet to discover him. The treachery had
      been kept secret; nobody could tell me where to find him; nobody could
      tell me who he was. What did it matter? When I had lived out the first
      agony, I could rely on myself&mdash;I could be patient, and bide my time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your time? What time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The time when I and that man shall meet face to face. I knew it then; I
      know it now&mdash;it was written on my heart then, it is written on my
      heart now&mdash;we two shall meet and know each other! With that
      conviction strong within me, I volunteered for this service, as I would
      have volunteered for anything that set work and hardship and danger, like
      ramparts, between my misery and me. With that conviction strong within me
      still, I tell you it is no matter whether I stay here with the sick, or go
      hence with the strong. I shall live till I have met that man! There is a
      day of reckoning appointed between us. Here in the freezing cold, or away
      in the deadly heat; in battle or in shipwreck; in the face of starvation;
      under the shadow of pestilence&mdash;I, though hundreds are falling round
      me, I shall live! live for the coming of one day! live for the meeting
      with one man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, trembling, body and soul, under the hold that his own terrible
      superstition had fastened on him. Crayford drew back in silent horror.
      Wardour noticed the action&mdash;he resented it&mdash;he appealed, in
      defense of his one cherished conviction, to Crayford's own experience of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me!" he cried. "Look how I have lived and thriven, with the
      heart-ache gnawing at me at home, and the winds of the icy north whistling
      round me here! I am the strongest man among you. Why? I have fought
      through hardships that have laid the best-seasoned men of all our party on
      their backs. Why? What have <i>I</i> done, that my life should throb as
      bravely through every vein in my body at this minute, and in this deadly
      place, as ever it did in the wholesome breezes of home? What am I
      preserved for? I tell you again, for the coming of one day&mdash;for the
      meeting with one man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused once more. This time Crayford spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard!" he said, "since we first met, I have believed in your better
      nature, against all outward appearance. I have believed in you, firmly,
      truly, as your brother might. You are putting that belief to a hard test.
      If your enemy had told me that you had ever talked as you talk now, that
      you had ever looked as you look now, I would have turned my back on him as
      the utterer of a vile calumny against a just, a brave, an upright man. Oh!
      my friend, my friend, if ever I have deserved well of you, put away these
      thoughts from your heart! Face me again, with the stainless look of a man
      who has trampled under his feet the bloody superstitions of revenge, and
      knows them no more! Never, never, let the time come when I cannot offer
      you my hand as I offer it now, to the man I can still admire&mdash;to the
      brother I can still love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart that no other voice could touch felt that appeal. The fierce
      eyes, the hard voice, softened under Crayford's influence. Richard
      Wardour's head sank on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are kinder to me than I deserve," he said. "Be kinder still, and
      forget what I have been talking about. No! no more about me; I am not
      worth it. We'll change the subject, and never go back to it again. Let's
      do something. Work, Crayford&mdash;that's the true elixir of our life!
      Work, that stretches the muscles and sets the blood a-glowing. Work, that
      tires the body and rests the mind. Is there nothing in hand that I can do?
      Nothing to cut? nothing to carry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened as he put the question. Bateson&mdash;appointed to chop
      Frank's bed-place into firing&mdash;appeared punctually with his ax.
      Wardour, without a word of warning, snatched the ax out of the man's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was this wanted for?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To cut up Mr. Aldersley's berth there into firing, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do it for you! I'll have it down in no time!" He turned to Crayford.
      "You needn't be afraid about me, old friend. I am going to do the right
      thing. I am going to tire my body and rest my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil spirit in him was plainly subdued&mdash;for the time, at least.
      Crayford took his hand in silence; and then (followed by Bateson) left him
      to his work.

    <h2>
      Chapter 10.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ax in hand, Wardour approached Frank's bed-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only cut the thoughts out of me," he said to himself, "as I am
      going to cut the billets out of this wood!" He attacked the bed-place with
      the ax, like a man who well knew the use of his instrument. "Oh me!" he
      thought, sadly, "if I had only been born a carpenter instead of a
      gentleman! A good ax, Master Bateson&mdash;I wonder where you got it?
      Something like a grip, my man, on this handle. Poor Crayford! his words
      stick in my throat. A fine fellow! a noble fellow! No use thinking, no use
      regretting; what is said, is said. Work! work! work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank after plank fell out on the floor. He laughed over the easy task of
      destruction. "Aha! young Aldersley! It doesn't take much to demolish your
      bed-place. I'll have it down! I would have the whole hut down, if they
      would only give me the chance of chopping at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A long strip of wood fell to his ax&mdash;long enough to require cutting
      in two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his eye&mdash;letters
      carved in the wood. He looked closer. The letters were very faintly and
      badly cut. He could only make out the first three of them; and even of
      those he was not quite certain. They looked like C L A&mdash;if they
      looked like anything. He threw down the strip of wood irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n the fellow (whoever he is) who cut this! Why should he carve <i>that</i>
      name, of all the names in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, considering&mdash;then determined to go on again with his
      self-imposed labor. He was ashamed of his own outburst. He looked eagerly
      for the ax. "Work, work! Nothing for it but work." He found the ax, and
      went on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut out another plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked at it suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was carving again, on this plank. The letters F. and A. appeared on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down the ax. There were vague misgivings in him which he was not
      able to realize. The state of his own mind was fast becoming a puzzle to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More carving," he said to himself. "That's the way these young idlers
      employ their long hours. F. A.? Those must be <i>his</i> initials&mdash;Frank
      Aldersley. Who carved the letters on the other plank? Frank Aldersley,
      too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the piece of wood in his hand nearer to the light, and looked
      lower down it. More carving again, lower down! Under the initials F. A.
      were two more letters&mdash;C. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      "C. B.?" he repeated to himself. "His sweet heart's initials, I suppose?
      Of course&mdash;at his age&mdash;his sweetheart's initials."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused once more. A spasm of inner pain showed the shadow of its
      mysterious passage, outwardly on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Her</i> cipher is C. B.," he said, in low, broken tones. "C. B.&mdash;Clara
      Burnham."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, with the plank in his hand; repeating the name over and over
      again, as if it was a question he was putting to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara Burnham? Clara Burnham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the plank, and turned deadly pale in a moment. His eyes
      wandered furtively backward and forward between the strip of wood on the
      floor and the half-demolished berth. "Oh, God! what has come to me now?"
      he said to himself, in a whisper. He snatched up the ax, with a strange
      cry&mdash;something between rage and terror. He tried&mdash;fiercely,
      desperately tried&mdash;to go on with his work. No! strong as he was, he
      could not use the ax. His hands were helpless; they trembled incessantly.
      He went to the fire; he held his hands over it. They still trembled
      incessantly; they infected the rest of him. He shuddered all over. He knew
      fear. His own thoughts terrified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crayford!" he cried out. "Crayford! come here, and let's go hunting."
    </p>
    <p>
      No friendly voice answered him. No friendly face showed itself at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interval passed; and there came over him another change. He recovered
      his self-possession almost as suddenly as he had lost it. A smile&mdash;a
      horrid, deforming, unnatural smile&mdash;spread slowly, stealthily,
      devilishly over his face. He left the fire; he put the ax away softly in a
      corner; he sat down in his old place, deliberately self-abandoned to a
      frenzy of vindictive joy. He had found the man! There, at the end of the
      world&mdash;there, at the last fight of the Arctic voyagers against
      starvation and death, he had found the man!
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became conscious, on a sudden, of a freezing stream of air pouring into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and saw Crayford opening the door of the hut. A man was behind
      him. Wardour rose eagerly, and looked over Crayford's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it&mdash;could it be&mdash;the man who had carved the letters on the
      plank? Yes! Frank Aldersley!

    <h2>
      Chapter 11.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Still at work!" Crayford exclaimed, looking at the half-demolished
      bed-place. "Give yourself a little rest, Richard. The exploring party is
      ready to start. If you wish to take leave of your brother officers before
      they go, you have no time to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself there, looking Wardour full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" he cried, "how pale you are! Has anything happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank&mdash;searching in his locker for articles of clothing which he
      might require on the journey&mdash;looked round. He was startled, as
      Crayford had been startled, by the sudden change in Wardour since they had
      last seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ill?" he asked. "I hear you have been doing Bateson's work for
      him. Have you hurt yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour suddenly moved his head, so as to hide his face from both Crayford
      and Frank. He took out his handkerchief, and wound it clumsily round his
      left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said; "I hurt myself with the ax. It's nothing. Never mind. Pain
      always has a curious effect on me. I tell you it's nothing! Don't notice
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his face toward them again as suddenly as he had turned it away.
      He advanced a few steps, and addressed himself with an uneasy familiarity
      to Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't answer you civilly when you spoke to me some little time since.
      I mean when I first came in here along with the rest of them. I apologize.
      Shake hands! How are you? Ready for the march?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank met the oddly abrupt advance which had been made to him with perfect
      good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to be friends with you, Mr. Wardour. I wish I was as well
      seasoned to fatigue as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour burst into a hard, joyless, unnatural laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not strong, eh? You don't look it. The dice had better have sent me away,
      and kept you here. I never felt in better condition in my life." He paused
      and added, with his eye on Frank and with a strong emphasis on the words:
      "We men of Kent are made of tough material."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank advanced a step on his side, with a new interest in Richard Wardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come from Kent?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. From East Kent." He waited a little once more, and looked hard at
      Frank. "Do you know that part of the country?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to know something about East Kent," Frank answered. "Some dear
      friends of mine once lived there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends of yours?" Wardour repeated. "One of the county families, I
      suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he put the question, he abruptly looked over his shoulder. He was
      standing between Crayford and Frank. Crayford, taking no part in the
      conversation, had been watching him, and listening to him more and more
      attentively as that conversation went on. Within the last moment or two
      Wardour had become instinctively conscious of this. He resented Crayford's
      conduct with needless irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you staring at me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you looking unlike yourself?" Crayford answered, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour made no reply. He renewed the conversation with Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the county families?" he resumed. "The Winterbys of Yew Grange, I
      dare say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Frank; "but friends of the Witherbys, very likely. The
      Burnhams."
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately as he struggled to maintain it, Wardour's self-control failed
      him. He started violently. The clumsily-wound handkerchief fell off his
      hand. Still looking at him attentively, Crayford picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is your handkerchief, Richard," he said. "Strange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is strange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told us you had hurt yourself with the ax&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no blood on your handkerchief."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour snatched the handkerchief out of Crayford's hand, and, turning
      away, approached the outer door of the hut. "No blood on the
      handkerchief," he said to himself. "There may be a stain or two when
      Crayford sees it again." He stopped within a few paces of the door, and
      spoke to Crayford. "You recommended me to take leave of my brother
      officers before it was too late," he said. "I am going to follow your
      advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened from the outer side as he laid his hand on the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the quartermasters of the <i>Wanderer</i> entered the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Captain Helding here, sir?" he asked, addressing himself to Wardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour pointed to Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lieutenant will tell you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford advanced and questioned the quartermaster. "What do you want with
      Captain Helding?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a report to make, sir. There has been an accident on the ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one of your men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. To one of our officers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour, on the point of going out, paused when the quartermaster made
      that reply. For a moment he considered with himself. Then he walked slowly
      back to the part of the room in which Frank was standing. Crayford,
      directing the quartermaster, pointed to the arched door way in the side of
      the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to hear of the accident," he said. "You will find Captain
      Helding in that room."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time, with singular persistency, Wardour renewed the
      conversation with Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you knew the Burnhams?" he said. "What became of Clara when her father
      died?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's face flushed angrily on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara!" he repeated. "What authorizes you to speak of Miss Burnham in
      that familiar manner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour seized the opportunity of quarreling with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What right have you to ask?" he retorted, coarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's blood was up. He forgot his promise to Clara to keep their
      engagement secret&mdash;he forgot everything but the unbridled insolence
      of Wardour's language and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A right which I insist on your respecting," he answered. "The right of
      being engaged to marry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford's steady eyes were still on the watch, and Wardour felt them on
      him. A little more and Crayford might openly interfere. Even Wardour
      recognized for once the necessity of controlling his temper, cost him what
      it might. He made his apologies, with overstrained politeness, to Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible to dispute such a right as yours," he said. "Perhaps you will
      excuse me when you know that I am one of Miss Burnham's old friends. My
      father and her father were neighbors. We have always met like brother and
      sister&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank generously stopped the apology there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say no more," he interposed. "I was in the wrong&mdash;I lost my temper.
      Pray forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour looked at him with a strange, reluctant interest while he was
      speaking. Wardour asked an extraordinary question when he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she very fond of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," he said, "come to our wedding, and judge for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to your wedding?" As he repeated the words Wardour stole one glance
      at Frank which Frank (employed in buckling his knapsack) failed to see.
      Crayford noticed it, and Crayford's blood ran cold. Comparing the words
      which Wardour had spoken to him while they were alone together with the
      words that had just passed in his presence, he could draw but one
      conclusion. The woman whom Wardour had loved and lost was&mdash;Clara
      Burnham. The man who had robbed him of her was Frank Aldersley. And
      Wardour had discovered it in the interval since they had last met. "Thank
      God!" thought Crayford, "the dice have parted them! Frank goes with the
      expedition, and Wardour stays behind with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection had barely occurred to him&mdash;Frank's thoughtless
      invitation to Wardour had just passed his lips&mdash;when the canvas
      screen over the doorway was drawn aside. Captain Helding and the officers
      who were to leave with the exploring party returned to the main room on
      their way out. Seeing Crayford, Captain Helding stopped to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a casualty to report," said the captain, "which diminishes our
      numbers by one. My second lieutenant, who was to have joined the exploring
      party, has had a fall on the ice. Judging by what the quartermaster tells
      me, I am afraid the poor fellow has broken his leg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will supply his place," cried a voice at the other end of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked round. The man who had spoken was Richard Wardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford instantly interfered&mdash;so vehemently as to astonish all who
      knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he said. "Not you, Richard! not you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" Wardour asked, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, indeed?" added Captain Helding. "Wardour is the very man to be
      useful on a long march. He is in perfect health, and he is the best shot
      among us. I was on the point of proposing him myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford failed to show his customary respect for his superior officer. He
      openly disputed the captain's conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wardour has no right to volunteer," he rejoined. "It has been settled,
      Captain Helding, that chance shall decide who is to go and who is to
      stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And chance <i>has</i> decided it," cried Wardour. "Do you think we are
      going to cast the dice again, and give an officer of the <i>Sea-mew</i> a
      chance of replacing an officer of the <i>Wanderer</i>? There is a vacancy
      in our party, not in yours; and we claim the right of filling it as we
      please. I volunteer, and my captain backs me. Whose authority is to keep
      me here after that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently, Wardour," said Captain Helding. "A man who is in the right can
      afford to speak with moderation." He turned to Crayford. "You must admit
      yourself," he continued, "that Wardour is right this time. The missing man
      belongs to my command, and in common justice one of my officers ought to
      supply his place."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to dispute the matter further. The dullest man present
      could see that the captain's reply was unanswerable. In sheer despair,
      Crayford took Frank's arm and led him aside a few steps. The last chance
      left of parting the two men was the chance of appealing to Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," he began, "I want to say one friendly word to you on the
      subject of your health. I have already, if you remember, expressed my
      doubts whether you are strong enough to make one of an exploring party. I
      feel those doubts more strongly than ever at this moment. Will you take
      the advice of a friend who wishes you well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour had followed Crayford. Wardour roughly interposed before Frank
      could reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford paid no heed to the interruption. He was too earnestly bent on
      withdrawing Frank from the expedition to notice anything that was said or
      done by the persons about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, pray don't, risk hardships which you are unfit to bear!" he went
      on, entreatingly. "Your place can be easily filled. Change your mind,
      Frank. Stay here with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Wardour interfered. Again he called out, "Leave him alone!" more
      roughly than ever. Still deaf and blind to every consideration but one,
      Crayford pressed his entreaties on Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You owned yourself just now that you were not well seasoned to fatigue,"
      he persisted. "You feel (you <i>must</i> feel) how weak that last illness
      has left you? You know (I am sure you know) how unfit you are to brave
      exposure to cold, and long marches over the snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated beyond endurance by Crayford's obstinacy; seeing, or thinking he
      saw, signs of yielding in Frank's face, Wardour so far forgot himself as
      to seize Crayford by the arm and attempt to drag him away from Frank.
      Crayford turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard," he said, very quietly, "you are not yourself. I pity you. Drop
      your hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour relaxed his hold, with something of the sullen submission of a
      wild animal to its keeper. The momentary silence which followed gave Frank
      an opportunity of speaking at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am gratefully sensible, Crayford," he began, "of the interest which you
      take in me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will follow my advice?" Crayford interposed, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mind is made up, old friend," Frank answered, firmly and sadly.
      "Forgive me for disappointing you. I am appointed to the expedition. With
      the expedition I go." He moved nearer to Wardour. In his innocence of all
      suspicion he clapped Wardour heartily on the shoulder. "When I feel the
      fatigue," said poor simple Frank, "you will help me, comrade&mdash;won't
      you? Come along!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour snatched his gun out of the hands of the sailor who was carrying
      it for him. His dark face became suddenly irradiated with a terrible joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come!" he cried. "Over the snow and over the ice! Come! where no human
      footsteps have ever trodden, and where no human trace is ever left."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blindly, instinctively, Crayford made an effort to part them. His brother
      officers, standing near, pulled him back. They looked at each other
      anxiously. The merciless cold, striking its victims in various ways, had
      struck in some instances at their reason first. Everybody loved Crayford.
      Was he, too, going on the dark way that others had taken before him? They
      forced him to seat himself on one of the lockers. "Steady, old fellow!"
      they said kindly&mdash;"steady!" Crayford yielded, writhing inwardly under
      the sense of his own helplessness. What in God's name could he do? Could
      he denounce Wardour to Captain Helding on bare suspicion&mdash;without so
      much as the shadow of a proof to justify what he said? The captain would
      decline to insult one of his officers by even mentioning the monstrous
      accusation to him. The captain would conclude, as others had already
      concluded, that Crayford's mind was giving way under stress of cold and
      privation. No hope&mdash;literally, no hope now, but in the numbers of the
      expedition. Officers and men, they all liked Frank. As long as they could
      stir hand or foot, they would help him on the way&mdash;they would see
      that no harm came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word of command was given; the door was thrown open; the hut emptied
      rapidly. Over the merciless white snow&mdash;under the merciless black sky&mdash;the
      exploring party began to move. The sick and helpless men, whose last hope
      of rescue centered in their departing messmates, cheered faintly. Some few
      whose days were numbered sobbed and cried like women. Frank's voice
      faltered as he turned back at the door to say his last words to the friend
      who had been a father to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you, Crayford!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford broke away from the officers near him; and, hurrying forward,
      seized Frank by both hands. Crayford held him as if he would never let him
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God preserve you, Frank! I would give all I have in the world to be with
      you. Good-by! Good-by!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank waved his hand&mdash;dashed away the tears that were gathering in
      his eyes&mdash;and hurried out. Crayford called after him, the last, the
      only warning that he could give:
    </p>
    <p>
      "While you can stand, keep with the main body, Frank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wardour, waiting till the last&mdash;Wardour, following Frank through the
      snow-drift&mdash;stopped, stepped back, and answered Crayford at the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      "While he can stand, he keeps with Me."

      Chapter 12.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alone! alone on the Frozen Deep!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arctic sun is rising dimly in the dreary sky. The beams of the cold
      northern moon, mingling strangely with the dawning light, clothe the snowy
      plains in hues of livid gray. An ice-field on the far horizon is moving
      slowly southward in the spectral light. Nearer, a stream of open water
      rolls its slow black waves past the edges of the ice. Nearer still,
      following the drift, an iceberg rears its crags and pinnacles to the sky;
      here, glittering in the moonbeams; there, looming dim and ghost-like in
      the ashy light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway on the long sweep of the lower slope of the iceberg, what objects
      rise, and break the desolate monotony of the scene? In this awful
      solitude, can signs appear which tell of human Life? Yes! The black
      outline of a boat just shows itself, hauled up on the berg. In an
      ice-cavern behind the boat the last red embers of a dying fire flicker
      from time to time over the figures of two men. One is seated, resting his
      back against the side of the cavern. The other lies prostrate, with his
      head on his comrade's knee. The first of these men is awake, and thinking.
      The second reclines, with his still white face turned up to the sky&mdash;sleeping
      or dead. Days and days since, these two have fallen behind on the march of
      the expedition of relief. Days and days since, these two have been given
      up by their weary and failing companions as doomed and lost. He who sits
      thinking is Richard Wardour. He who lies sleeping or dead is Frank
      Aldersley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iceberg drifts slowly, over the black water, through the ashy light.
      Minute by minute the dying fire sinks. Minute by minute the deathly cold
      creeps nearer and nearer to the lost men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Wardour rouses himself from his thoughts&mdash;looks at the still
      white face beneath him&mdash;and places his hand on Frank's heart. It
      still beats feebly. Give him his share of the food and fuel still stored
      in the boat, and Frank may live through it. Leave him neglected where he
      lies, and his death is a question of hours&mdash;perhaps minutes; who
      knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Wardour lifts the sleeper's head and rests it against the cavern
      side. He goes to the boat, and returns with a billet of wood. He stoops to
      place the wood on the fire&mdash;and stops. Frank is dreaming, and
      murmuring in his dream. A woman's name passes his lips. Frank is in
      England again&mdash;at the ball&mdash;whispering to Clara the confession
      of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Richard Wardour's face there passes the shadow of a deadly thought.
      He rises from the fire; he takes the wood back to the boat. His iron
      strength is shaken, but it still holds out. They are drifting nearer and
      nearer to the open sea. He can launch the boat without help; he can take
      the food and the fuel with him. The sleeper on the iceberg is the man who
      has robbed him of Clara&mdash;who has wrecked the hope and the happiness
      of his life. Leave the man in his sleep, and let him die!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the tempter whispers. Richard Wardour tries his strength on the boat.
      It moves: he has got it under control. He stops, and looks round. Beyond
      him is the open sea. Beneath him is the man who has robbed him of Clara.
      The shadow of the deadly thought grows and darkens over his face. He waits
      with his hands on the boat&mdash;waits and thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iceberg drifts slowly&mdash;over the black water; through the ashy
      light. Minute by minute, the dying fire sinks. Minute by minute, the
      deathly cold creeps nearer to the sleeping man. And still Richard Wardour
      waits&mdash;waits and thinks.

    <h2>
      Chapter 13.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spring has come. The air of the April night just lifts the leaves of
      the sleeping flowers. The moon is queen in the cloudless and starless sky.
      The stillness of the midnight hour is abroad, over land and over sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a villa on the westward shore of the Isle of Wight, the glass doors
      which lead from the drawing-room to the garden are yet open. The shaded
      lamp yet burns on the table. A lady sits by the lamp, reading. From time
      to time she looks out into the garden, and sees the white-robed figure of
      a young girl pacing slowly to and fro in the soft brightness of the
      moonlight on the lawn. Sorrow and suspense have set their mark on the
      lady. Not rivals only, but friends who formerly admired her, agree now
      that she looks worn and aged. The more merciful judgment of others
      remarks, with equal truth, that her eyes, her hair, her simple grace and
      grandeur of movement have lost but little of their olden charms. The truth
      lies, as usual, between the two extremes. In spite of sorrow and
      suffering, Mrs. Crayford is the beautiful Mrs. Crayford still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicious silence of the hour is softly disturbed by the voice of the
      younger lady in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to the piano, Lucy. It is a night for music. Play something that is
      worthy of the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford looks round at the clock on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Clara, it is past twelve! Remember what the doctor told you. You
      ought to have been in bed an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half an hour, Lucy&mdash;give me half an hour more! Look at the moonlight
      on the sea. Is it possible to go to bed on such a night as this? Play
      something, Lucy&mdash;something spiritual and divine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earnestly pleading with her friend, Clara advances toward the window. She
      too has suffered under the wasting influences of suspense. Her face has
      lost its youthful freshness; no delicate flush of color rises on it when
      she speaks. The soft gray eyes which won Frank's heart in the by-gone time
      are sadly altered now. In repose, they have a dimmed and wearied look. In
      action, they are wild and restless, like eyes suddenly wakened from
      startling dreams. Robed in white&mdash;her soft brown hair hanging loosely
      over her shoulders&mdash;there is something weird and ghost-like in the
      girl, as she moves nearer and nearer to the window in the full light of
      the moon&mdash;pleading for music that shall be worthy of the mystery and
      the beauty of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in here if I play to you?" Mrs. Crayford asks. "It is a
      risk, my love, to be out so long in the night air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! I like it. Play&mdash;while I am out here looking at the sea. It
      quiets me; it comforts me; it does me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glides back, ghost-like, over the lawn. Mrs. Crayford rises, and puts
      down the volume that she has been reading. It is a record of explorations
      in the Arctic seas. The time has gone by when the two lonely women could
      take an interest in subjects not connected with their own anxieties. Now,
      when hope is fast failing them&mdash;now, when their last news of the <i>Wanderer</i>
      and the <i>Sea-mew</i> is news that is more than two years old&mdash;they
      can read of nothing, they can think of nothing, but dangers and
      discoveries, losses and rescues in the terrible Polar seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwillingly, Mrs. Crayford puts her book aside, and opens the piano&mdash;Mozart's
      "Air in A, with Variations," lies open on the instrument. One after
      another she plays the lovely melodies, so simply, so purely beautiful, of
      that unpretending and unrivaled work. At the close of the ninth Variation
      (Clara's favorite), she pauses, and turns toward the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I stop there?" she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no answer. Has Clara wandered away out of hearing of the music
      that she loves&mdash;the music that harmonizes so subtly with the tender
      beauty of the night? Mrs. Crayford rises and advances to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! there is the white figure standing alone on the slope of the lawn&mdash;the
      head turned away from the house; the face looking out over the calm sea,
      whose gently rippling waters end in the dim line on the horizon which is
      the line of the Hampshire coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford advances as far as the path before the window, and calls to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there is no answer. The white figure still stands immovably in its
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      With signs of distress in her face, but with no appearance of alarm, Mrs.
      Crayford returns to the room. Her own sad experience tells her what has
      happened. She summons the servants and directs them to wait in the
      drawing-room until she calls to them. This done, she returns to the
      garden, and approaches the mysterious figure on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead to the outer world, as if she lay already in her grave&mdash;insensible
      to touch, insensible to sound, motionless as stone, cold as stone&mdash;Clara
      stands on the moonlit lawn, facing the seaward view. Mrs. Crayford waits
      at her side, patiently watching for the change which she knows is to come.
      "Catalepsy," as some call it&mdash;"hysteria," as others say&mdash;this
      alone is certain, the same interval always passes; the same change always
      appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It comes now. Not a change in her eyes; they still remain wide open, fixed
      and glassy. The first movement is a movement of her hands. They rise
      slowly from her side and waver in the air like the hands of a person
      groping in the dark. Another interval, and the movement spreads to her
      lips: they part and tremble. A few minutes more, and words begin to drop,
      one by one, from those parted lips&mdash;words spoken in a lost, vacant
      tone, as if she is talking in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford looks back at the house. Sad experience makes her suspicious
      of the servants' curiosity. Sad experience has long since warned her that
      the servants are not to be trusted within hearing of the wild words which
      Clara speaks in the trance. Has any one of them ventured into the garden?
      No. They are out of hearing at the window, waiting for the signal which
      tells them that their help is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning toward Clara once more, Mrs. Crayford hears the vacantly uttered
      words, falling faster and faster from her lips,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank! Frank! Frank! Don't drop behind&mdash;don't trust Richard Wardour.
      While you can stand, keep with the other men, Frank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      (The farewell warning of Crayford in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep,
      repeated by Clara in the garden of her English home!)
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of silence follows; and, in that moment, the vision has changed.
      She sees him on the iceberg now, at the mercy of the bitterest enemy he
      has on earth. She sees him drifting&mdash;over the black water, through
      the ashy light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake, Frank! wake and defend yourself! Richard Wardour knows that I love
      you&mdash;Richard Wardour's vengeance will take your life! Wake, Frank&mdash;wake!
      You are drifting to your death!" A low groan of horror bursts from her,
      sinister and terrible to hear. "Drifting! drifting!" she whispers to
      herself&mdash;"drifting to his death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glassy eyes suddenly soften&mdash;then close. A long shudder runs
      through her. A faint flush shows itself on the deadly pallor of her face,
      and fades again. Her limbs fail her. She sinks into Mrs. Crayford's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants, answering the call for help, carry her into the house. They
      lay her insensible on her bed. After half an hour or more, her eyes open
      again&mdash;this time with the light of life in them&mdash;open, and rest
      languidly on the friend sitting by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had a dreadful dream," she murmurs faintly. "Am I ill, Lucy? I
      feel so weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as she says the words, sleep, gentle, natural sleep, takes her
      suddenly, as it takes young children weary with their play. Though it is
      all over now, though no further watching is required, Mrs. Crayford still
      keeps her place by the bedside, too anxious and too wakeful to retire to
      her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On other occasions, she is accustomed to dismiss from her mind the words
      which drop from Clara in the trance. This time the effort to dismiss them
      is beyond her power. The words haunt her. Vainly she recalls to memory all
      that the doctors have said to her, in speaking of Clara in the state of
      trance. "What she vaguely dreads for the lost man whom she loves is
      mingled in her mind with what she is constantly reading, of trials,
      dangers, and escapes in the Arctic seas. The most startling things that
      she may say or do are all attributable to this cause, and may all be
      explained in this way." So the doctors have spoken; and, thus far, Mrs.
      Crayford has shared their view. It is only to-night that the girl's words
      ring in her ear, with a strange prophetic sound in them. It is only
      to-night that she asks herself: "Is Clara present, in the spirit, with our
      loved and lost ones in the lonely North? Can mortal vision see the dead
      and living in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep?"

    <h2>
      Chapter 14.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far and near the garden view looked its gayest and brightest in the light
      of the noonday sun. The cheering sounds which tell of life and action were
      audible all round the villa. From the garden of the nearest house rose the
      voices of children at play. Along the road at the back sounded the roll of
      wheels, as carts and carriages passed at intervals. Out on the blue sea,
      the distant splash of the paddles, the distant thump of the engines, told
      from time to time of the passage of steamers, entering or leaving the
      strait between the island and the mainland. In the trees, the birds sang
      gayly among the rustling leaves. In the house, the women-servants were
      laughing over some jest or story that cheered them at their work. It was a
      lively and pleasant time&mdash;a bright, enjoyable day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies were out together; resting on a garden seat, after a walk
      round the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged a few trivial words relating to the beauty of the day, and
      then said no more. Possessing the same consciousness of what she had seen
      in the trance which persons in general possess of what they have seen in a
      dream&mdash;believing in the vision as a supernatural revelation&mdash;Clara's
      worst forebodings were now, to her mind, realized as truths. Her last
      faint hope of ever seeing Frank again was now at an end. Intimate
      experience of her told Mrs. Crayford what was passing in Clara's mind, and
      warned her that the attempt to reason and remonstrate would be little
      better than a voluntary waste of words and time. The disposition which she
      had herself felt on the previous night, to attach a superstitious
      importance to the words that Clara had spoken in the trance, had vanished
      with the return of the morning. Rest and reflection had quieted her mind,
      and had restored the composing influence of her sober sense. Sympathizing
      with Clara in all besides, she had no sympathy, as they sat together in
      the pleasant sunshine, with Clara's gloomy despair of the future. She, who
      could still hope, had nothing to say to the sad companion who had done
      with hope. So the quiet minutes succeeded each other, and the two friends
      sat side by side in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, and the gate-bell of the villa rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both started&mdash;they both knew the ring. It was the hour when the
      postman brought their newspapers from London. In past days, what hundreds
      on hundreds of times they had torn off the cover which inclosed the
      newspaper, and looked at the same column with the same weary mingling of
      hope and despair! There to-day&mdash;as it was yesterday; as it would be,
      if they lived, to-morrow&mdash;there was the servant with Lucy's newspaper
      and Clara's newspaper in his hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Would both of them do again to-day what both had done so often in the days
      that were gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! Mrs. Crayford removed the cover from her newspaper as usual. Clara
      laid <i>her</i> newspaper aside, unopened, on the garden seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence, Mrs. Crayford looked, where she always looked, at the column
      devoted to the Latest Intelligence from foreign parts. The instant her eye
      fell on the page she started with a loud cry of joy. The newspaper fell
      from her trembling hand. She caught Clara in her arms. "Oh, my darling! my
      darling! news of them at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, without the slightest change in look or manner, Clara
      took the newspaper from the ground, and read the top line in the column,
      printed in capital letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, and looked at Mrs. Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you bear to hear it, Lucy," she asked, "if I read it aloud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford was too agitated to answer in words. She signed impatiently
      to Clara to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara read the news which followed the heading in capital letters. Thus it
      ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The following intelligence, from St. Johns, Newfoundland, has reached us
      for publication. The whaling-vessel <i>Blythewood</i> is reported to have
      met with the surviving officers and men of the Expedition in Davis Strait.
      Many are stated to be dead, and some are supposed to be missing. The list
      of the saved, as collected by the people of the whaler, is not vouched for
      as being absolutely correct, the circumstances having been adverse to
      investigation. The vessel was pressed for time; and the members of the
      Expedition, all more or less suffering from exhaustion, were not in a
      position to give the necessary assistance to inquiry. Further particulars
      may be looked for by the next mail."
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of the survivors followed, beginning with the officers in the
      order of their rank. They both read the list together. The first name was
      Captain Helding; the second was Lieutenant Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the wife's joy overpowered her. After a pause, she put her arm
      around Clara's waist, and spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my love!" she murmured, "are you as happy as I am? Is Frank's name
      there too? The tears are in my eyes. Read for me&mdash;I can't read for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came, in still, sad tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read as far as your husband's name. I have no need to read
      further."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford dashed the tears from her eyes&mdash;steadied herself&mdash;and
      looked at the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the list of the survivors, the search was vain. Frank's name was not
      among them. On a second list, headed "Dead or Missing," the first two
      names that appeared were:
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANCIS ALDERSLEY. RICHARD WARDOUR.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speechless distress and dismay, Mrs. Crayford looked at Clara. Had she
      force enough in her feeble health to sustain the shock that had fallen on
      her? Yes! she bore it with a strange unnatural resignation&mdash;she
      looked, she spoke, with the sad self-possession of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was prepared for it," she said. "I saw them in the spirit last night.
      Richard Wardour has discovered the truth; and Frank has paid the penalty
      with his life&mdash;and I, I alone, am to blame." She shuddered, and put
      her hand on her heart. "We shall not be long parted, Lucy. I shall go to
      him. He will not return to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words were spoken with a calm certainty of conviction that was
      terrible to hear. "I have no more to say," she added, after a moment, and
      rose to return to the house. Mrs. Crayford caught her by the hand, and
      forced her to take her seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't look at me, don't speak to me, in that horrible manner!" she
      exclaimed. "Clara! it is unworthy of a reasonable being, it is doubting
      the mercy of God, to say what you have just said. Look at the newspaper
      again. See! They tell you plainly that their information is not to be
      depended on&mdash;they warn you to wait for further particulars. The very
      words at the top of the list show how little they knew of the truth 'Dead
      <i>or</i> Missing!' On their own showing, it is quite as likely that Frank
      is missing as that Frank is dead. For all you know, the next mail may
      bring a letter from him. Are you listening to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you deny what I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes!' 'No!' Is that the way to answer me when I am so distressed and so
      anxious about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I spoke as I did, Lucy. We look at some subjects in very
      different ways. I don't dispute, dear, that yours is the reasonable view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't dispute?" retorted Mrs. Crayford, warmly. "No! you do what is
      worse&mdash;you believe in your own opinion; you persist in your own
      conclusion&mdash;with the newspaper before you! Do you, or do you not,
      believe the newspaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe in what I saw last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what you saw last night! You, an educated woman, a clever woman,
      believing in a vision of your own fancy&mdash;a mere dream! I wonder you
      are not ashamed to acknowledge it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it a dream if you like, Lucy. I have had other dreams at other times&mdash;and
      I have known them to be fulfilled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said Mrs. Crayford. "For once in a way they may have been
      fulfilled, by chance&mdash;and you notice it, and remember it, and pin
      your faith on it. Come, Clara, be honest!&mdash;What about the occasions
      when the chance has been against you, and your dreams have not been
      fulfilled? You superstitious people are all alike. You conveniently forget
      when your dreams and your presentiments prove false. For my sake, dear, if
      not for your own," she continued, in gentler and tenderer tones, "try to
      be more reasonable and more hopeful. Don't lose your trust in the future,
      and your trust in God. God, who has saved my husband, can save Frank.
      While there is doubt, there is hope. Don't embitter my happiness, Clara!
      Try to think as I think&mdash;if it is only to show that you love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her arm round the girl's neck, and kissed her. Clara returned the
      kiss; Clara answered, sadly and submissively,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do love you, Lucy. I <i>will</i> try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having answered in those terms, she sighed to herself, and said no more.
      It would have been plain, only too plain, to far less observant eyes than
      Mrs. Crayford's that no salutary impression had been produced on her. She
      had ceased to defend her own way of thinking, she spoke of it no more&mdash;but
      there was the terrible conviction of Frank's death at Wardour's hands
      rooted as firmly as ever in her mind! Discouraged and distressed, Mrs.
      Crayford left her, and walked back toward the house.

    <h2>
      Chapter 15.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the drawing-room window of the villa there appeared a polite little
      man, with bright intelligent eyes, and cheerful sociable manners. Neatly
      dressed in professional black, he stood, self-proclaimed, a prosperous
      country doctor&mdash;successful and popular in a wide circle of patients
      and friends. As Mrs. Crayford approached him, he stepped out briskly to
      meet her on the lawn, with both hands extended in courteous and cordial
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear madam, accept my heartfelt congratulations!" cried the doctor. "I
      have seen the good news in the paper; and I could hardly feel more
      rejoiced than I do now if I had the honor of knowing Lieutenant Crayford
      personally. We mean to celebrate the occasion at home. I said to my wife
      before I came out, 'A bottle of the old Madeira at dinner to-day, mind!&mdash;to
      drink the lieutenant's health; God bless him!' And how is our interesting
      patient? The news is not altogether what we could wish, so far as she is
      concerned. I felt a little anxious, to tell you the truth, about the
      effect of it; and I have paid my visit to-day before my usual time. Not
      that I take a gloomy view of the news myself. No! There is clearly a doubt
      about the correctness of the information, so far as Mr. Aldersley is
      concerned&mdash;and that is a point, a great point in Mr. Aldersley's
      favor. I give him the benefit of the doubt, as the lawyers say. Does Miss
      Burnham give him the benefit of the doubt too? I hardly dare hope it, I
      confess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Burnham has grieved and alarmed me," Mrs. Crayford answered. "I was
      just thinking of sending for you when we met here."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those introductory words, she told the doctor exactly what had
      happened; repeating not only the conversation of that morning between
      Clara and herself, but also the words which had fallen from Clara, in the
      trance of the past night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor listened attentively. Little by little, its easy smiling
      composure vanished from his face, as Mrs. Crayford went on, and left him
      completely transformed into a grave and thoughtful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go and look at her," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself by Clara's side, and carefully studied her face, with
      his hand on her pulse. There was no sympathy here between the dreamy
      mystical temperament of the patient and the downright practical character
      of the doctor. Clara secretly disliked her medical attendant. She
      submitted impatiently to the close investigation of which he made her the
      object. He questioned her&mdash;and she answered irritably. Advancing a
      step further (the doctor was not easily discouraged) he adverted to the
      news of the Expedition, and took up the tone of remonstrance which had
      been already adopted by Mrs. Crayford. Clara declined to discuss the
      question. She rose with formal politeness, and requested permission to
      return to the house. The doctor attempted no further resistance. "By all
      means, Miss Burnham," he answered, resignedly&mdash;having first cast a
      look at Mrs. Crayford which said plainly, "Stay here with me." Clara bowed
      her acknowledgments in cold silence, and left them together. The doctor's
      bright eyes followed the girl's wasted, yet still graceful figure as it
      slowly receded from view, with an expression of grave anxiety which Mrs.
      Crayford noticed with grave misgiving on her side. He said nothing, until
      Clara had disappeared under the veranda which ran round the garden-side of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you told me," he began, "that Miss Burnham has neither father nor
      mother living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Miss Burnham is an orphan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she any near relatives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You may speak to me as her guardian and her friend. Are you alarmed
      about her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am seriously alarmed. It is only two days since I called here last, and
      I see a marked change in her for the worse&mdash;physically and morally, a
      change for the worse. Don't needlessly alarm yourself! The case is not, I
      trust, entirely beyond the reach of remedy. The great hope for us is the
      hope that Mr. Aldersley may still be living. In that event, I should feel
      no misgivings about the future. Her marriage would make a healthy and a
      happy woman of her. But as things are, I own I dread that settled
      conviction in her mind that Mr. Aldersley is dead, and that her own death
      is soon to follow. In her present state of health this idea (haunting her
      as it certainly will night and day) will have its influence on her body as
      well as on her mind. Unless we can check the mischief, her last reserves
      of strength will give way. If you wish for other advice, by all means send
      for it. You have my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite satisfied with your opinion," Mrs. Crayford replied. "For
      God's sake, tell me, what can we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can try a complete change," said the doctor. "We can remove her at
      once from this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will refuse to leave it," Mrs. Crayford rejoined. "I have more than
      once proposed a change to her&mdash;and she always says No."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused for a moment, like a man collecting his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard something on my way here," he proceeded, "which suggests to my
      mind a method of meeting the difficulty that you have just mentioned.
      Unless I am entirely mistaken, Miss Burnham will not say No to the change
      that I have in view for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked Mrs. Crayford, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me if I ask you a question, on my part, before I reply," said the
      doctor. "Are you fortunate enough to possess any interest at the
      Admiralty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. My father is in the Secretary's office; and two of the Lords
      of the Admiralty are friends of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent! Now I can speak out plainly with little fear of disappointing
      you. After what I have said, you will agree with me, that the only change
      in Miss Burnham's life which will be of any use to her is a change that
      will alter the present tone of her mind on the subject of Mr. Aldersley.
      Place her in a position to discover&mdash;not by reference to her own
      distempered fancies and visions, but by reference to actual evidence and
      actual fact&mdash;whether Mr. Aldersley is, or is not, a living man; and
      there will be an end of the hysterical delusions which now threaten to
      fatally undermine her health. Even taking matters at their worst&mdash;even
      assuming that Mr. Aldersley has died in the Arctic seas&mdash;it will be
      less injurious to her to discover this positively, than to leave her mind
      to feed on its own morbid superstitions and speculations, for weeks and
      weeks together, while the next news from the Expedition is on its way to
      England. In one word, I want you to be in a position, before the week is
      out, to put Miss Burnham's present conviction to a practical test. Suppose
      you could say to her, 'We differ, my dear, about Mr. Francis Aldersley.
      You declare, without the shadow of a reason for it, that he is certainly
      dead, and, worse still, that he has died by the act of one of his brother
      officers. I assert, on the authority of the newspaper, that nothing of the
      sort has happened, and that the chances are all in favor of his being
      still a living man. What do you say to crossing the Atlantic, and deciding
      which of us is right&mdash;you or I?' Do you think Miss Burnham will say
      No to that, Mrs. Crayford? If I know anything of human nature, she will
      seize the opportunity as a means of converting you to a belief in the
      Second Sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens, doctor! do you mean to tell me that we are to go to sea and
      meet the Arctic Expedition on its way home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably guessed, Mrs. Crayford! That is exactly what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how is it to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you immediately. I mentioned&mdash;didn't I?&mdash;that I had
      heard something on my road to this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I met an old friend at my own gate, who walked with me a part of
      the way here. Last night my friend dined with the admiral at Portsmouth.
      Among the guests there was a member of the Ministry who had brought the
      news about the Expedition with him from London. This gentleman told the
      company there was very little doubt that the Admiralty would immediately
      send out a steam-vessel, to meet the rescued men on the shores of America,
      and bring them home. Wait a little, Mrs. Crayford! Nobody knows, as yet,
      under what rules and regulations the vessel will sail. Under somewhat
      similar circumstances, privileged people have been received as passengers,
      or rather as guests, in her majesty's ships&mdash;and what has been
      conceded on former occasions may, by bare possibility, be conceded now. I
      can say no more. If you are not afraid of the voyage for yourself, I am
      not afraid of it (nay, I am all in favor of it on medical grounds) for my
      patient. What do you say? Will you write to your father, and ask him to
      try what his interest will do with his friends at the Admiralty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford rose excitedly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Write!" she exclaimed. "I will do better than write. The journey to
      London is no great matter&mdash;and my housekeeper here is to be trusted
      to take care of Clara in my absence. I will see my father to-night! He
      shall make good use of his interest at the Admiralty&mdash;you may rely on
      that. Oh, my dear doctor, what a prospect it is! My husband! Clara! What a
      discovery you have made&mdash;what a treasure you are! How can I thank
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compose yourself, my dear madam. Don't make too sure of success. We may
      consider Miss Burnham's objections as disposed of beforehand. But suppose
      the Lords of the Admiralty say No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, I shall be in London, doctor; and I shall go to them
      myself. Lords are only men; and men are not in the habit of saying No to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week from that day, her majesty's ship <i>Amazon</i> sailed for North
      America. Certain privileged persons, specially interested in the Arctic
      voyagers, were permitted to occupy the empty state-rooms on board. On the
      list of these favored guests of the ship were the names of two ladies&mdash;Mrs.
      Crayford and Miss Burnham.

      Chapter 16.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once more the open sea&mdash;the sea whose waters break on the shores of
      Newfoundland! An English steamship lies at anchor in the offing. The
      vessel is plainly visible through the open doorway of a large boat-house
      on the shore&mdash;one of the buildings attached to a fishing-station on
      the coast of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person in the boat-house at this moment is a man in the dress of
      a sailor. He is seated on a chest, with a piece of cord in his hand,
      looking out idly at the sea. On the rough carpenter's table near him lies
      a strange object to be left in such a place&mdash;a woman's veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the vessel lying at anchor in the offing?
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel is the <i>Amazon</i>&mdash;dispatched from England to receive
      the surviving officers and men of the Arctic Expedition. The meeting has
      been successfully effected, on the shores of North America, three days
      since. But the homeward voyage has been delayed by a storm which has
      driven the ship out of her course. Taking advantage, on the third day, of
      the first returning calm, the commander of the <i>Amazon</i> has anchored
      off the coast of Newfoundland, and has sent ashore to increase his
      supplies of water before he sails for England. The weary passengers have
      landed for a few hours, to refresh themselves after the discomforts of the
      tempest. Among them are the two ladies. The veil left on the table in the
      boat-house is Clara's veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who is the man sitting on the chest, with the cord in his hand,
      looking out idly at the sea? The man is the only cheerful person in the
      ship's company. In other words&mdash;John Want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still reposing on the chest, our friend, who never grumbles, is surprised
      by the sudden appearance of a sailor at the boat-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look sharp with your work there, John Want!" says the sailor. "Lieutenant
      Crayford is just coming in to look after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this warning the messenger disappears again. John Want rises with a
      groan, turns the chest up on one end, and begins to fasten the cord round
      it. The ship's cook is not a man to look back on his rescue with the
      feeling of unmitigated satisfaction which animates his companions in
      trouble. On the contrary, he is ungratefully disposed to regret the North
      Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had only known"&mdash;thus runs the train of thought in the mind of
      John Want&mdash;"if I had only known, before I was rescued, that I was to
      be brought to this place, I believe I should have preferred staying at the
      North Pole. I was very happy keeping up everybody's spirits at the North
      Pole. Taking one thing with another, I think I must have been very
      comfortable at the North Pole&mdash;if I had only known it. Another man in
      my place might be inclined to say that this Newfoundland boat-house was
      rather a sloppy, slimy, draughty, fishy sort of a habitation to take
      shelter in. Another man might object to perpetual Newfoundland fogs,
      perpetual Newfoundland cod-fish, and perpetual Newfoundland dogs. We had
      some very nice bears at the North Pole. Never mind! it's all one to me&mdash;<i>I</i>
      don't grumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you done cording that box?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the voice is a voice of authority&mdash;the man at the doorway
      is Lieutenant Crayford himself. John Want answers his officer in his own
      cheerful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done it as well as I can, sir&mdash;but the damp of this place is
      beginning to tell upon our very ropes. I say nothing about our lungs&mdash;I
      only say our ropes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford answers sharply. He seems to have lost his former relish for the
      humor of John Want.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! To look at your wry face, one would think that our rescue from the
      Arctic regions was a downright misfortune. You deserve to be sent back
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could be just as cheerful as ever, sir, if I <i>was</i> sent back
      again; I hope I'm thankful; but I don't like to hear the North Pole run
      down in such a fishy place as this. It was very clean and snowy at the
      North Pole&mdash;and it's very damp and sandy here. Do you never miss your
      bone-soup, sir? <i>I</i> do. It mightn't have been strong; but it was very
      hot; and the cold seemed to give it a kind of a meaty flavor as it went
      down. Was it you that was a-coughing so long last night, sir? I don't
      presume to say anything against the air of these latitudes; but I should
      be glad to know it wasn't you that was a-coughing so hollow. Would you be
      so obliging as just to feel the state of these ropes with the ends of your
      fingers, sir? You can dry them afterward on the back of my jacket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have a stick laid on the back of your jacket. Take that box
      down to the boat directly. You croaking vagabond! You would have grumbled
      in the Garden of Eden."
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher of the Expedition was not a man to be silenced by
      referring him to the Garden of Eden. Paradise itself was not perfect to
      John Want.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I could be cheerful anywhere, sir," said the ship's cook. "But you
      mark my words&mdash;there must have been a deal of troublesome work with
      the flower-beds in the Garden of Eden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having entered that unanswerable protest, John Want shouldered the box,
      and drifted drearily out of the boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Crayford looked at his watch, and called to a sailor
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are the ladies?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Crayford is coming this way, sir. She was just behind you when you
      came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Miss Burnham with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; Miss Burnham is down on the beach with the passengers. I heard
      the young lady asking after you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asking after me?" Crayford considered with himself as he repeated the
      words. He added, in lower and graver tones, "You had better tell Miss
      Burnham you have seen me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man made his salute and went out. Crayford took a turn in the
      boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rescued from death in the Arctic wastes, and reunited to a beautiful wife,
      the lieutenant looked, nevertheless, unaccountably anxious and depressed.
      What could he be thinking of? He was thinking of Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day when the rescued men were received on board the <i>Amazon</i>,
      Clara had embarrassed and distressed, not Crayford only, but the other
      officers of the Expedition as well, by the manner in which she questioned
      them on the subject of Francis Aldersley and Richard Wardour. She had
      shown no signs of dismay or despair when she heard that no news had been
      received of the two missing men. She had even smiled sadly to herself,
      when Crayford (out of compassionate regard for her) declared that he and
      his comrades had not given up the hope of seeing Frank and Wardour yet. It
      was only when the lieutenant had expressed himself in those terms and when
      it was hoped that the painful subject had been dismissed&mdash;that Clara
      had startled every one present by announcing that she had something still
      to say in relation to Frank and Wardour, which had not been said yet.
      Though she spoke guardedly, her next words revealed suspicions of foul
      play lurking in her mind&mdash;exactly reflecting similar suspicions
      lurking in Crayford's mind&mdash;which so distressed the lieutenant, and
      so surprised his comrades, as to render them quite incapable of answering
      her. The warnings of the storm which shortly afterward broke over the
      vessel were then visible in sea and sky. Crayford made them his excuse for
      abruptly leaving the cabin in which the conversation had taken place. His
      brother officers, profiting by his example, pleaded their duties on deck,
      and followed him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, and the next, the tempest still raged&mdash;and the
      passengers were not able to leave their state-rooms. But now, when the
      weather had moderated and the ship had anchored&mdash;now, when officers
      and passengers alike were on shore, with leisure time at their disposal&mdash;Clara
      had opportunities of returning to the subject of the lost men, and of
      asking questions in relation to them which would make it impossible for
      Crayford to plead an excuse for not answering her. How was he to meet
      those questions? How could he still keep her in ignorance of the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the reflections which now troubled Crayford, and which
      presented him, after his rescue, in the strangely inappropriate character
      of a depressed and anxious man. His brother officers, as he well knew,
      looked to him to take the chief responsibility. If he declined to accept
      it, he would instantly confirm the horrible suspicion in Clara's mind. The
      emergency must be met; but how to meet it&mdash;at once honorably and
      mercifully&mdash;was more than Crayford could tell. He was still lost in
      his own gloomy thoughts when his wife entered the boat-house. Turning to
      look at her, he saw his own perturbations and anxieties plainly reflected
      in Mrs. Crayford's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen anything of Clara?" he asked. "Is she still on the beach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is following me to this place," Mrs. Crayford replied. "I have been
      speaking to her this morning. She is just as resolute as ever to insist on
      your telling her of the circumstances under which Frank is missing. As
      things are, you have no alternative but to answer her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help me to answer her, Lucy. Tell me, before she comes in, how this
      dreadful suspicion first took possession of her. All she could possibly
      have known when we left England was that the two men were appointed to
      separate ships. What could have led her to suspect that they had come
      together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was firmly persuaded, William, that they <i>would</i> come together
      when the Expedition left England. And she had read in books of Arctic
      travel, of men left behind by their comrades on the march, and of men
      adrift on ice-bergs. With her mind full of these images and forebodings,
      she saw Frank and Wardour (or dreamed of them) in one of her attacks of
      trance. I was by her side; I heard what she said at the time. She warned
      Frank that Wardour had discovered the truth. She called out to him, 'While
      you can stand, keep with the other men, Frank!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" cried Crayford; "I warned him myself, almost in those very
      words, the last time I saw him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't acknowledge it, William! Keep her in ignorance of what you have
      just told me. She will not take it for what it is&mdash;a startling
      coincidence, and nothing more. She will accept it as positive confirmation
      of the faith, the miserable superstitious faith, that is in her. So long
      as you don't actually know that Frank is dead, and that he has died by
      Wardour's hand, deny what she says&mdash;mislead her for her own sake&mdash;dispute
      all her conclusions as I dispute them. Help me to raise her to the better
      and nobler belief in the mercy of God!" She stopped, and looked round
      nervously at the doorway. "Hush!" she whispered. "Do as I have told you.
      Clara is here."

    <h2>
      Chapter 17.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clara stopped at the doorway, looking backward and forward distrustfully
      between the husband and wife. Entering the boat-house, and approaching
      Crayford, she took his arm, and led him away a few steps from the place in
      which Mrs. Crayford was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no storm now, and there are no duties to be done on board the
      ship," she said, with the faint, sad smile which it wrung Crayford's heart
      to see. "You are Lucy's husband, and you have an interest in me for Lucy's
      sake. Don't shrink on that account from giving me pain: I can bear pain.
      Friend and brother! will you believe that I have courage enough to hear
      the worst? Will you promise not to deceive me about Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle resignation in her voice, the sad pleading in her look, shook
      Crayford's self-possession at the outset. He answered her in the worst
      possible manner; he answered evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Clara," he said, "what have I done that you should suspect me of
      deceiving you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him searchingly in the face, then glanced with renewed distrust
      at Mrs. Crayford. There was a moment of silence. Before any of the three
      could speak again, they were interrupted by the appearance of one of
      Crayford's brother officers, followed by two sailors carrying a hamper
      between them. Crayford instantly dropped Clara's arm, and seized the
      welcome opportunity of speaking of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any instructions from the ship, Steventon?" he asked, approaching the
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verbal instructions only," Steventon replied. "The ship will sail with
      the flood-tide. We shall fire a gun to collect the people, and send
      another boat ashore. In the meantime here are some refreshments for the
      passengers. The ship is in a state of confusion; the ladies will eat their
      luncheon more comfortably here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this, Mrs. Crayford took <i>her</i> opportunity of silencing Clara
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, my dear," she said. "Let us lay the cloth before the gentlemen come
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara was too seriously bent on attaining the object which she had in view
      to be silenced in that way. "I will help you directly," she answered&mdash;then
      crossed the room and addressed herself to the officer, whose name was
      Steventon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you spare me a few minutes?" she asked. "I have something to say to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am entirely at your service, Miss Burnham."
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering in those words, Steventon dismissed the two sailors. Mrs.
      Crayford looked anxiously at her husband. Crayford whispered to her,
      "Don't be alarmed about Steventon. I have cautioned him; his discretion is
      to be depended on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara beckoned to Crayford to return to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not keep you long," she said. "I will promise not to distress Mr.
      Steventon. Young as I am, you shall both find that I am capable of
      self-control. I won't ask you to go back to the story of your past
      sufferings; I only want to be sure that I am right about one thing&mdash;I
      mean about what happened at the time when the exploring party was
      dispatched in search of help. As I understand it, you cast lots among
      yourselves who was to go with the party, and who was to remain behind.
      Frank cast the lot to go." She paused, shuddering. "And Richard Wardour,"
      she went on, "cast the lot to remain behind. On your honor, as officers
      and gentlemen, is this the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my honor," Crayford answered, "it is the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my honor," Steventon repeated, "it is the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at them, carefully considering her next words, before she spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You both drew the lot to stay in the huts," she said, addressing Crayford
      and Steventon. "And you are both here. Richard Wardour drew the lot to
      stay, and Richard Wardour is not here. How does his name come to be with
      Frank's on the list of the missing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was a dangerous one to answer. Steventon left it to Crayford
      to reply. Once again he answered evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't follow, my dear," he said, "that the two men were missing
      together because their names happen to come together on the list."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara instantly drew the inevitable conclusion from that ill-considered
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank is missing from the party of relief," she said. "Am I to understand
      that Wardour is missing from the huts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Crayford and Steventon hesitated. Mrs. Crayford cast one indignant
      look at them, and told the necessary lie, without a moment's hesitation!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" she said. "Wardour is missing from the huts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly as she had spoken, she had still spoken too late. Clara had
      noticed the momentary hesitation on the part of the two officers. She
      turned to Steventon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust to your honor," she said, quietly. "Am I right, or wrong, in
      believing that Mrs. Crayford is mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had addressed herself to the right man of the two. Steventon had no
      wife present to exercise authority over him. Steventon, put on his honor,
      and fairly forced to say something, owned the truth. Wardour had replaced
      an officer whom accident had disabled from accompanying the party of
      relief, and Wardour and Frank were missing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara looked at Mrs. Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear?" she said. "It is you who are mistaken, not I. What you call
      'Accident,' what I call 'Fate,' brought Richard Wardour and Frank together
      as members of the same Expedition, after all." Without waiting for a
      reply, she again turned to Steventon, and surprised him by changing the
      painful subject of the conversation of her own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been in the Highlands of Scotland?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never been in the Highlands," the lieutenant replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever read, in books about the Highlands, of such a thing as 'The
      Second Sight'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you believe in the Second Sight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Steventon politely declined to commit himself to a direct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what I might have done, if I had ever been in the
      Highlands," he said. "As it is, I have had no opportunities of giving the
      subject any serious consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't put your credulity to the test," Clara proceeded. "I won't ask
      you to believe anything more extraordinary than that I had a strange dream
      in England not very long since. My dream showed me what you have just
      acknowledged&mdash;and more than that. How did the two missing men come to
      be parted from their companions? Were they lost by pure accident, or were
      they deliberately left behind on the march?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford made a last vain effort to check her inquiries at the point which
      they had now reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither Steventon nor I were members of the party of relief," he said.
      "How are we to answer you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your brother officers who <i>were</i> members of the party must have told
      you what happened," Clara rejoined. "I only ask you and Mr. Steventon to
      tell me what they told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford interposed again, with a practical suggestion this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The luncheon is not unpacked yet," she said. "Come, Clara! this is our
      business, and the time is passing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The luncheon can wait a few minutes longer," Clara answered. "Bear with
      my obstinacy," she went on, laying her hand caressingly on Crayford's
      shoulder. "Tell me how those two came to be separated from the rest. You
      have always been the kindest of friends&mdash;don't begin to be cruel to
      me now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she made her entreaty to Crayford went straight to the
      sailor's heart. He gave up the hopeless struggle: he let her see a glimpse
      of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the third day out," he said, "Frank's strength failed him. He fell
      behind the rest from fatigue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely they waited for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a serious risk to wait for him, my child. Their lives (and the
      lives of the men they had left in the huts) depended, in that dreadful
      climate, on their pushing on. But Frank was a favorite. They waited half a
      day to give Frank the chance of recovering his strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stopped. There the imprudence into which his fondness for Clara
      had led him showed itself plainly, and closed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to take refuge in silence. Clara was determined on hearing
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She questioned Steventon next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Frank go on again after the half-day's rest?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tried to go on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And failed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did the men do when he failed? Did they turn cowards? Did they
      desert Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had purposely used language which might irritate Steventon into
      answering her plainly. He was a young man&mdash;he fell into the snare
      that she had set for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one among them was a coward, Miss Burnham!" he replied, warmly. "You
      are speaking cruelly and unjustly of as brave a set of fellows as ever
      lived! The strongest man among them set the example; he volunteered to
      stay by Frank, and to bring him on in the track of the exploring party."
    </p>
    <p>
      There Steventon stopped&mdash;conscious, on his side, that he had said too
      much. Would she ask him who this volunteer was? No. She went straight on
      to the most embarrassing question that she had put yet&mdash;referring to
      the volunteer, as if Steventon had already mentioned his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What made Richard Wardour so ready to risk his life for Frank's sake?"
      she said to Crayford. "Did he do it out of friendship for Frank? Surely
      you can tell me that? Carry your memory back to the days when you were all
      living in the huts. Were Frank and Wardour friends at that time? Did you
      never hear any angry words pass between them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There Mrs. Crayford saw her opportunity of giving her husband a timely
      hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child!" she said; "how can you expect him to remember that? There
      must have been plenty of quarrels among the men, all shut up together, and
      all weary of each other's company, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty of quarrels!" Crayford repeated; "and every one of them made up
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And every one of them made up again," Mrs. Crayford reiterated, in her
      turn. "There! a plainer answer than that you can't wish to have. Now are
      you satisfied? Mr. Steventon, come and lend a hand (as you say at sea)
      with the hamper&mdash;Clara won't help me. William, don't stand there
      doing nothing. This hamper holds a great deal; we must have a division of
      labor. Your division shall be laying the tablecloth. Don't handle it in
      that clumsy way! You unfold a table-cloth as if you were unfurling a sail.
      Put the knives on the right, and the forks on the left, and the napkin and
      the bread between them. Clara, if you are not hungry in this fine air, you
      ought to be. Come and do your duty; come and have some lunch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up as she spoke. Clara appeared to have yielded at last to the
      conspiracy to keep her in the dark. She had returned slowly to the
      boat-house doorway, and she was standing alone on the threshold, looking
      out. Approaching her to lead her to the luncheon-table, Mrs. Crayford
      could hear that she was speaking softly to herself. She was repeating the
      farewell words which Richard Wardour had spoken to her at the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A time may come when I shall forgive <i>you</i>. But the man who has
      robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met.' Oh, Frank!
      Frank! does Richard still live, with your blood on his conscience, and my
      image in his heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips suddenly closed. She started, and drew back from the doorway,
      trembling violently. Mrs. Crayford looked out at the quiet seaward view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything there that frightens you, my dear?" she asked. "I can see
      nothing, except the boats drawn up on the beach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> can see nothing either, Lucy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you are trembling as if there was something dreadful in the view
      from this door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There <i>is</i> something dreadful! I feel it, though I see nothing. I
      feel it, nearer and nearer in the empty air, darker and darker in the
      sunny light. I don't know what it is. Take me away! No. Not out on the
      beach. I can't pass the door. Somewhere else! somewhere else!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford looked round her, and noticed a second door at the inner end
      of the boat-house. She spoke to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See where that door leads to, William."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford opened the door. It led into a desolate inclosure, half garden,
      half yard. Some nets stretched on poles were hanging up to dry. No other
      objects were visible&mdash;not a living creature appeared in the place.
      "It doesn't look very inviting, my dear," said Mrs. Crayford. "I am at
      your service, however. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered her arm to Clara as she spoke. Clara refused it. She took
      Crayford's arm, and clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm frightened, dreadfully frightened!" she said to him, faintly. "You
      keep with me&mdash;a woman is no protection; I want to be with you." She
      looked round again at the boat-house doorway. "Oh!" she whispered, "I'm
      cold all over&mdash;I'm frozen with fear of this place. Come into the
      yard! Come into the yard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave her to me," said Crayford to his wife. "I will call you, if she
      doesn't get better in the open air."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her out at once, and closed the yard door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Steventon, do you understand this?" asked Mrs. Crayford. "What can
      she possibly be frightened of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the question, still looking mechanically at the door by which her
      husband and Clara had gone out. Receiving no reply, she glanced round at
      Steventon. He was standing on the opposite side of the luncheon-table,
      with his eyes fixed attentively on the view from the main doorway of the
      boat-house. Mrs. Crayford looked where Steventon was looking. This time
      there was something visible. She saw the shadow of a human figure
      projected on the stretch of smooth yellow sand in front of the boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more the figure appeared. A man came slowly into view, and
      stopped on the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 18.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man was a sinister and terrible object to look at. His eyes glared
      like the eyes of a wild animal; his head was bare; his long gray hair was
      torn and tangled; his miserable garments hung about him in rags. He stood
      in the doorway, a speechless figure of misery and want, staring at the
      well-spread table like a hungry dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steventon spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, in a hoarse, hollow voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      "A starving man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced a few steps, slowly and painfully, as if he were sinking under
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throw me some bones from the table," he said. "Give me my share along
      with the dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was madness as well as hunger in his eyes while he spoke those
      words. Steventon placed Mrs. Crayford behind him, so that he might be
      easily able to protect her in case of need, and beckoned to two sailors
      who were passing the door of the boat-house at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give the man some bread and meat," he said, "and wait near him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcast seized on the bread and meat with lean, long-nailed hands that
      looked like claws. After his first mouthful of the food, he stopped,
      considered vacantly with himself, and broke the bread and meat into two
      portions. One portion he put into an old canvas wallet that hung over his
      shoulder; the other he devoured voraciously. Steventon questioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrecked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Steventon turned to Mrs. Crayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be some truth in the poor wretch's story," he said. "I heard
      something of a strange boat having been cast on the beach thirty or forty
      miles higher up the coast. When were you wrecked, my man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The starving creature looked up from his food, and made an effort to
      collect his thoughts&mdash;to exert his memory. It was not to be done. He
      gave up the attempt in despair. His language, when he spoke, was as wild
      as his looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you," he said. "I can't get the wash of the sea out of my
      ears. I can't get the shining stars all night, and the burning sun all
      day, out of my brain. When was I wrecked? When was I first adrift in the
      boat? When did I get the tiller in my hand and fight against hunger and
      sleep? When did the gnawing in my breast, and the burning in my head,
      first begin? I have lost all reckoning of it. I can't think; I can't
      sleep; I can't get the wash of the sea out of my ears. What are you
      baiting me with questions for? Let me eat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the sailors pitied him. The sailors asked leave of their officer to
      add a little drink to his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got a drop of grog with us, sir, in a bottle. May we give it to
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the bottle fiercely, as he had taken the food, drank a little,
      stopped, and considered with himself again. He held up the bottle to the
      light, and, marking how much liquor it contained, carefully drank half of
      it only. This done, he put the bottle in his wallet along with the food.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you saving it up for another time?" said Steventon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm saving it up," the man answered. "Never mind what for. That's my
      secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the boat-house as he made that reply, and noticed Mrs.
      Crayford for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman among you!" he said. "Is she English? Is she young? Let me look
      closer at her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced a few steps toward the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid, Mrs. Crayford," said Steventon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not afraid," Mrs. Crayford replied. "He frightened me at first&mdash;he
      interests me now. Let him speak to me if he wishes it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He never spoke. He stood, in dead silence, looking long and anxiously at
      the beautiful Englishwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Steventon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head sadly, and drew back again with a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he said to himself, "that's not <i>her</i> face. No! not found yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford's interest was strongly excited. She ventured to speak to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it you want to find?" she asked. "Your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, then? What is she like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered that question in words. His hoarse, hollow voice softened,
      little by little, into sorrowful and gentle tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young," he said; "with a fair, sad face&mdash;with kind, tender eyes&mdash;with
      a soft, clear voice. Young and loving and merciful. I keep her face in my
      mind, though I can keep nothing else. I must wander, wander, wander&mdash;restless,
      sleepless, homeless&mdash;till I find <i>her!</i> Over the ice and over
      the snow; tossing on the sea, tramping over the land; awake all night,
      awake all day; wander, wander, wander, till I find <i>her!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand with a gesture of farewell, and turned wearily to go
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Crayford opened the yard door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you had better come to Clara," he began, and checked himself,
      noticing the stranger. "Who is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The shipwrecked man, hearing another voice in the room, looked round
      slowly over his shoulder. Struck by his appearance, Crayford advanced a
      little nearer to him. Mrs. Crayford spoke to her husband as he passed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only a poor, mad creature, William," she whispered&mdash;"shipwrecked
      and starving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mad?" Crayford repeated, approaching nearer and nearer to the man. "Am <i>I</i>
      in my right senses?" He suddenly sprang on the outcast, and seized him by
      the throat. "Richard Wardour!" he cried, in a voice of fury. "Alive!&mdash;alive,
      to answer for Frank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man struggled. Crayford held him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Frank?" he said. "You villain, where is Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man resisted no longer. He repeated vacantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Villain? and where is Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the name escaped his lips, Clara appeared at the open yard door, and
      hurried into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard Richard's name!" she said. "I heard Frank's name! What does it
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her voice the outcast renewed the struggle to free
      himself, with a sudden frenzy of strength which Crayford was not able to
      resist. He broke away before the sailors could come to their officer's
      assistance. Half-way down the length of the room he and Clara met one
      another face to face. A new light sparkled in the poor wretch's eyes; a
      cry of recognition burst from his lips. He flung one hand up wildly in the
      air. "Found!" he shouted, and rushed out to the beach before any of the
      men present could stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crayford put her arms round Clara and held her up. She had not made a
      movement: she had not spoken a word. The sight of Wardour's face had
      petrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed, and there rose a sudden burst of cheering from the
      sailors on the beach, near the spot where the fishermen's boats were drawn
      up. Every man left his work. Every man waved his cap in the air. The
      passengers, near at hand, caught the infection of enthusiasm, and joined
      the crew. A moment more, and Richard Wardour appeared again in the
      doorway, carrying a man in his arms. He staggered, breathless with the
      effort that he was making, to the place where Clara stood, held up in Mrs.
      Crayford's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saved, Clara!" he cried. "Saved for <i>you!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He released the man, and placed him in Clara's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank! foot-sore and weary&mdash;but living&mdash;saved; saved for <i>her!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Clara!" cried Mrs. Crayford, "which of us is right? I who believed
      in the mercy of God? or you who believed in a dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She never answered; she clung to Frank in speechless ecstasy. She never
      even looked at the man who had preserved him, in the first absorbing joy
      of seeing Frank alive. Step by step, slower and slower, Richard Wardour
      drew back, and left them by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may rest now," he said, faintly. "I may sleep at last. The task is
      done. The struggle is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      His last reserves of strength had been given to Frank. He stopped&mdash;he
      staggered&mdash;his hands waved feebly in search of support. But for one
      faithful friend he would have fallen. Crayford caught him. Crayford laid
      his old comrade gently on some sails strewn in a corner, and pillowed
      Wardour's weary head on his own bosom. The tears streamed over his face.
      "Richard! dear Richard!" he said. "Remember&mdash;and forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard neither heeded nor heard him. His dim eyes still looked across the
      room at Clara and Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made <i>her</i> happy!" he murmured. "I may lay down my weary head
      now on the mother earth that hushes all her children to rest at last.
      Sink, heart! sink, sink to rest! Oh, look at them!" he said to Crayford,
      with a burst of grief. "They have forgotten <i>me</i> already."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true! The interest was all with the two lovers. Frank was young and
      handsome and popular. Officers, passengers, and sailors, they all crowded
      round Frank. They all forgot the martyred man who had saved him&mdash;the
      man who was dying in Crayford's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford tried once more to attract his attention&mdash;to win his
      recognition while there was yet time. "Richard, speak to me! Speak to your
      old friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He look round; he vacantly repeated Crayford's last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend?" he said. "My eyes are dim, friend&mdash;my mind is dull. I have
      lost all memories but the memory of <i>her</i>. Dead thoughts&mdash;all
      dead thoughts but that one! And yet you look at me kindly! Why has your
      face gone down with the wreck of all the rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; his face changed; his thoughts drifted back from present to
      past; he looked at Crayford vacantly, lost in the terrible remembrances
      that were rising in him, as the shadows rise with the coming night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark ye, friend," he whispered. "Never let Frank know it. There was a
      time when the fiend within me hungered for his life. I had my hands on the
      boat. I heard the voice of the Tempter speaking to me: Launch it, and
      leave him to die! I waited with my hands on the boat, and my eyes on the
      place where he slept. 'Leave him! leave him!' the voice whispered. 'Love
      him!' the lad's voice answered, moaning and murmuring in his sleep. 'Love
      him, Clara, for helping <i>me!</i>' I heard the morning wind come up in
      the silence over the great deep. Far and near, I heard the groaning of the
      floating ice; floating, floating to the clear water and the balmy air. And
      the wicked Voice floated away with it&mdash;away, away, away forever!
      'Love him! love him, Clara, for helping <i>me!</i>' No wind could float
      that away! 'Love him, Clara&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank into silence; his head dropped on Crayford's breast. Frank
      saw it. Frank struggled up on his bleeding feet and parted the friendly
      throng round him. Frank had not forgotten the man who had saved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go to him!" he cried. "I must and will go to him! Clara, come with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara and Steventon supported him between them. He fell on his knees at
      Wardour's side; he put his hand on Wardour's bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary eyes opened again. The sinking voice was heard feebly once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! poor Frank. I didn't forget you, Frank, when I came here to beg. I
      remembered you lying down outside in the shadow of the boats. I saved you
      your share of the food and drink. Too weak to get at it now! A little
      rest, Frank! I shall soon be strong enough to carry you down to the ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      The end was near. They all saw it now. The men reverently uncovered their
      heads in the presence of Death. In an agony of despair, Frank appealed to
      the friends round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get something to strengthen him, for God's sake! Oh, men! men! I should
      never have been here but for him! He has given all his strength to my
      weakness; and now, see how strong I am, and how weak <i>he</i> is! Clara,
      I held by his arm all over the ice and snow. <i>He</i> kept watch when I
      was senseless in the open boat. <i>His</i> hand dragged me out of the
      waves when we were wrecked. Speak to him, Clara! speak to him!" His voice
      failed him, and his head dropped on Wardour's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke, as well as her tears would let her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard, have you forgotten me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rallied at the sound of that beloved voice. He looked up at her as she
      knelt at his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgotten you?" Still looking at her, he lifted his hand with an effort,
      and laid it on Frank. "Should I have been strong enough to save him, if I
      could have forgotten you?" He waited a moment and turned his face feebly
      toward Crayford. "Stay!" he said. "Someone was here and spoke to me." A
      faint light of recognition glimmered in his eyes. "Ah, Crayford! I
      recollect now. Dear Crayford! come nearer! My mind clears, but my eyes
      grow dim. You will remember me kindly for Frank's sake? Poor Frank! why
      does he hide his face? Is he crying? Nearer, Clara&mdash;I want to look my
      last at <i>you</i>. My sister, Clara! Kiss me, sister, kiss me before I
      die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stooped and kissed his forehead. A faint smile trembled on his lips.
      It passed away; and stillness possessed the face&mdash;the stillness of
      Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayford's voice was heard in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The loss is ours," he said. "The gain is his. He has won the greatest of
      all conquests&mdash;the conquest of himself. And he has died in the moment
      of victory. Not one of us here but may live to envy <i>his</i> glorious
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The distant report of a gun came from the ship in the offing, and signaled
      the return to England and to home.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
